<p>One of the fundamental assumptions we make in Statics is that bodies are <em>rigid</em>, that is, they do not deform, bend, or change shape when forces and moments are applied. While we know that this assumption is not true for real materials, we are building the analytical tools necessary to analyze deformation. In this chapter you will learn to compute the internal loads, which are the forces and moments within a body which hold it together as it supports its own weight and any applied loads. </p>
<p>The chapter begins with a discussion of internal forces and moments and defines a new sign conventions especially for them.  Discussion of how to find internal loads at a specific point within a rigid body follows.  The chapter concludes with three techniques to find internal loads throughout a beam. Note that the words <em>loads</em> or <em>loading</em> as opposed to <em>forces</em> are used here when we are referring to both forces and bending moments.</p>
<p>In courses you take after Statics, finding the internal loading is the first step you will take to determine stresses, strains, deformations and ultimately select the appropriate shape, size, and material necessary for structural elements to safely support the applied loads. So you are advised to pay attention, and master this topic.</p><assemblage xml:id="application-deformation">

<title>Application: Deformation</title>


<p>The controlling design parameter for most engineering systems is deformation. Thankfully, due to a property called elasticity, most materials will bend, stretch, and compress, long before they ultimately break. For example, when designing the floor in a new building, the floor is often limited to deflecting less than the length of the span in inches, divided by 360. Any more deformation than this would be considered disconcerting to the building residents and also start damaging surface materials (like drywall). For example, for a <m>\ft{20}</m> span, the deflection would need to be less than <me>\delta = \dfrac{\ft{20} \cdot \dfrac{\inch{12}}{\ft{1}}}{360}=\inch{0.667}</me>.</p>
<p/>
<p>To meet this deformation limit, we need to consider the magnitude and location of applied loads, the size and shape of the floor beams, and the material the floor beams are made from. As deflection is an internal property of the flooring materials, the first step is to determine the internal loadings that arise from the externally applied loads, which you will learn in this chapter.</p></assemblage></introduction><section xml:id="ch08-definition">

<title>Internal Loads</title>


<p>In <xref ref="two-force-bodies"/> you were introduced to axial internal loadings, loadings which were either tension or compression, or possibly zero. This section will explain two other internal loads found in two-dimensional systems, the internal shear and internal bending moment.</p>
<p>Internal loads are present at every point within a rigid body, but they always occur in equal-and-opposite pairs which cancel each other out, so they're not obvious.  The're there however, and when an object is cut (in your imagination) into two parts the internal loads become visible and can be determined. </p>
<p>You are familiar with straight, two-force members which only exist in equilibrium if equal and opposite forces act on either end.  Now imagine that we cut the member at some point along its length.  To maintain equilibrium, forces must exist at the cut location.  These forces are the internal forces and they are act in the axial direction along the long axis of the member.</p>

<p>In this interactive you may change the external forces on this two-force member  from tension to compression, and then cut the beam into sections. You will see that each piece must have an internal force to balance the external force. If you move the cut point, you'll see that the value of the internal force is constant at every location.</p></instructions></interactive></figure>
<p>Now let's examine the two-force member shown in <xref ref="dogleg_cut"/>. This time, the member is <em>L</em> shaped, not straight, but the external forces must still share the same line of action to maintain equilibrium. If you cut across the object, you will obtain two rigid bodies which must also be in equilibrium. However, adding forces perpendicular to the cuts won't produce static equilibrium since the forces aren't in opposing directions.  If you cut vertically and apply horizontal forces, that won't produce equilibrium either because equal and opposite forces offset like this form a couple and the pieces will rotate. This means that something is missing!</p><figure xml:id="dogleg_cut">

<p/>
<p>If you recall, two dimensional rigid bodies have three degrees-of-freedom and require three equilibrium equations to satisfy for static equilibrium.</p>
<p><m>\Sigma F_x = 0</m> prevented translation in the <m>x</m> direction, </p>
<p><m>\Sigma F_y = 0</m> prevented translation in the <m>y</m> direction, and </p>
<p><m>\Sigma M_z = 0</m> prevented rotation. </p>
<p>Since we know the two halves must be in equilibrium, we must balance forces in the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> directions and clockwise and counterclockwise moments. Assuming the material is rigid, the connection between the two halves resists both translation and rotation, so we can model this connection as a fixed support and replace the removed half of the link with a force reaction and a couple-moment reaction as shown in the free body diagrams of <xref ref="dogleg_cut_fbd"/>. We have resolved the force reaction into components parallel and perpendicular to the cut, and these components have special names in the context of internal loads: </p>
<p>The internal force component perpendicular to the cut is called the <term>normal force</term>. This is the same internal tension or compression force that we assumed to be the only significant internal load for trusses. If the object has an axis, and the cut is perpendicular to it, the the normal force may also be properly called an <term>axial force</term>.</p>
<p>The internal force component parallel to the cut is called the <term>shear force</term>. The word shear refers to the shearing between that occurs between adjacent planes due to this force. You can get a feel for shearing adjacent planes by sliding two pieces of paper together.</p>
<p>The internal couple moment is called the <term>bending moment</term> because it tends to bend the material by rotating the cut surface. </p>
<p>To be concise, the shear force is often simply referred to as <term>shear,</term> and the bending moment as <term>moment</term>; together with the normal or axial force the three are referred to as the <q>internal loading</q>.  The symbol <m>\vec{V}</m> is commonly chosen for the shear force, and <m>\vec{A}</m>, <m>\vec{P}</m> or <m>\vec{N}</m> for the normal force.</p>

<title>Thinking Deeper: Resultant Loading</title>


<p>The internal loadings are a simplification of what actually is a more complex loading distributed across the section plane. We can represent this complex force distribution with a single resultant force <m>\vec{F}</m> and couple <m>\vec{M}</m>. Force  <m>\vec{F}</m>  can be resolved into two orthogonal components, one parallel and the other perpendicular to the cut. The couple <m>\vec{M}</m> is the internal bending moment and represents the net rotational effect of the force system on the surface of the cut. </p><sidebyside><image width="75%" source="images/dogleg_internal.png"><remix><creator href="mailto:dan.baker@colostate.edu">Dan Baker</creator><license href="https://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/"/></remix></image></sidebyside>

<title>Sign Conventions</title>


<p>When talking about internal loads our standard sign convention for forces and moments is not good enough.  We can't, for instance, just call a vertical shear force positive if it points up  and negative if it points down, because internal forces always occur in pairs so at any given point a shear force is <em>both</em> up and down.  The direction of the internal force at a point depends on which side of the cut you're looking at. </p>
<p>So to define the state of internal loads at a point we need a better sign convention.  Although the choice is somewhat arbitrary, agreeing on a <em>standard</em> sign convention allows us to have consistency across our calculations and to communicate the internal state clearly to others. The standard sign conventions defined here are used for internal loadings at a point and also for the shear and bending moment diagrams which are discussed in <xref ref="VM_diagrams"/>. </p>
<p>Be aware that although this new sign convention applies all internal loads, it doesn't change the sign convention for the <xref provisional="equilibrium-equations" text="title">equations of equilibrium</xref> at all, so you will continue to solve them in the same way you alway have.</p>
<p>The standard convention for each of the three internal loads is summarized <xref ref="VM_sign_convention"/>.</p><list xml:id="VM_sign_convention">

<title>Internal loads at a point</title>


<p>This section covers the procedure to compute the internal normal force, shear force, and bending moment at a designated point in a multiforce rigid body. </p>
<p>Consider the frame shown in <xref ref="frame_space_diagram"/>, consisting of two two-force members, <m>GD</m> and <m>BE</m>, and two multiforce members, <m>AD</m> and <m>CF</m>. Since no information is provided, assume that the components have negligible weight.  The internal loading within the two-force members is purely axial, but the multiforce members will be subject to the complete set of internal loadings.</p>

<p>To find the internal loadings at a specific point within one of the members, we make an imaginary cut there. </p>
<p><xref ref="frame_1"/> shows the free body digram of member <m>AD</m>, with a proposed cut between points <m>D</m> and <m>C</m>. The free body diagram is shown with reactions for pinned connections at <m>A</m> and <m>C</m> and forces from the two-force members at locations <m>B</m> and <m>D</m>. </p>

<p>Once the location of the cut has been decided, we separate the free body diagram of the member into two independent free body diagrams, one above the cut and one below. This is analogous to the Method of Sections technique of <xref provisional="Chapter_06"/>. The free body diagrams for the two sections of the member are shown in <xref ref="frame_2"/>.  The three internal forces are are exposed and labeled <m>\vec{A}</m>, <m>\vec{V}</m>, and <m>\vec{M}</m>. Either free body diagram can be used to solve for the internal forces, so it is wise to choose the easier one.   Recognizing which one is easier takes practice, but look for the piece with more knowns and fewer unknown values.</p>

<p>Note that the internal loadings at the cut are drawn in the positive direction according to the <xref ref="VM_sign_convention" text="custom">sign conventions</xref> for internal loads, that they act in opposite direction either side of the cut, and they would cancel out if the object was put back together.</p>
<p>You can also use this technique to solve for the internal loads on a beam with a distributed load, as shown in the examples below.</p><investigation xml:id="Chapter_08-internal-loads-at-a-point-internal-loads-in-a-simply-supported-beam">

<p>At each cut, a shear force, a normal force, and a bending moment will be exposed, and these need to be included on the free body diagram. </p>

<title>Shear and Bending Moment Diagrams</title>

<introduction>
<p>The previous section addressed a method to find shear and bending moment at a single point, which is useful, but this technique is of little use if you want to know the shear and moment at <em>every</em> point in the object.  Shear and bending moment diagrams are a way for us to do that, easily.</p>
<p>For the remainder of this chapter, we will limit our analysis to beams, which are structural elements primarily designed to support vertical loads. When designing a beam it is important to locate the points of maximum shear and maximum moment and their magnitudes because that's where it is most likely to fail. To find these weak points, we need to check the internal loading at every point along the beam's full length. We use shear and bending moment diagrams to do this.</p>
<p>You will learn three related but different methods to produce shear and bending moment diagrams, and the chapter will conclude with a comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of each method.</p></introduction><subsection xml:id="VM_diagrams-shear-and-bending-moment-diagrams">

<title>Shear and Bending Moment Diagrams</title>


<p>Shear and moment diagrams are graphs of the internal shear and bending moment plotted along the length of the beam. They allow us to find where the maximum loads occur in order to prevent failure and to optimize the design to reduce the overall weight and cost of a structure. </p>
<p>Since beams primarily support vertical loads, the normal forces are small and also independent of shear and moment, so they will not be considered in this section.</p>
<p>Beams can be supported in a variety of ways as shown in <xref ref="beam_supports"/>. Beam support types include:  
<ol><li>a simply supported beam with a pin on one end and a roller at the other, </li><li>a cantilevered beam which is fixed on one end, and </li><li>an overhanging beam which acts as a combination of a simply supported and cantilever beam.</li></ol></p>

<title>Section Cut Method</title>


<p>In this section we'll extend the previous method where we found internal loadings at a specific point to find the internal load at every point by developing equations, by cutting at an variable location <m>x</m>.</p>
<p>The difference between cutting a beam at a specific point, and cutting at point <m>x</m> is that the resulting equilibrium equations will include <m>x</m> rather than a known distance, and the resulting equations for shear and moment will be functions of <m>x</m>. To find the internal loads at a specific point we can just substitute in that   point's location for <m>x</m>.</p>
<p>As an example, we will use a cantilevered beam fixed to a wall on its left end and subject to a vertical force <m>P</m> on its right end as an example.</p>
<p>By taking a cut at a location a distance <m>x</m> from the left we can draw two free body diagrams with lengths <m>x</m> and <m>(L-x)</m>.  This beam has <em>one</em> loading segment, because no matter where <m>x</m> is chosen, the free body diagrams shown in <xref ref="cuts_1"/> are correct.</p>
<p/><figure xml:id="cuts_1">

<caption/>

<image width="55%" source="images/cuts1.png"/><remix><creator href="mailto:dan.baker@colostate.edu">Dan Baker</creator><license href="https://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/"/></remix></figure>
<p>To find the shear and loading functions, apply the equilibrium to one of the free body diagrams.  Either side will work, so we’ll select the right-hand portion as it doesn’t require us to find the reactions at <m>A</m>. </p>
<p>Using a standard coordinate system, the equations of equilibrium are:</p>
<p><md><mrow>\Sigma F_y\amp=0</mrow><mrow>V-P\amp=0</mrow><mrow>\Sigma M_\text{cut}\amp=0</mrow><mrow>-M-P(L-x)\amp=0</mrow></md></p>
<p>where <m>L</m> is the length of the beam. </p>
<p>We can solve these to find that  <m>V=P</m> and <m>M=-P(x-L)</m>. This indicates that the shear force <m>V</m> is constant over the length of the beam and the moment <m>M</m> is a linear function of location <m>x</m>.</p>
<p>This example was simple because because only one <acro>FBD</acro> was necessary for any point on the beam. But many beams are more complex than this one. Beams with multiple loads must be broken into loading segments between each point where a load is applied or changes. </p>
<p>The beam in <xref ref="cuts_2"/> has three loading segments but the procedure is similar, however in this case you must draw and analyze three free body diagrams, one for each segment. </p>

<p>The equations of <m>V</m> and <m>M</m> from each segment are joined to plot the shear and moment diagrams.  These diagrams help us visualize the change in the values of <m>V</m> and <m>M</m> everywhere within the beam. </p>
<p>When writing equations for loading segments, you may choose either
<ul label="square"><li><em>global equations</em><mdash/> all segments use the same origin, usually at the left end of the beam.</li><li><em>local equations</em><mdash/> each segment uses its own origin, usually at the left end of the segment.</li></ul></p>
<p>Often local equations are easier because you can simply use the variable <m>x</m> in your equations as opposed to <q><m>x</m> + constant</q>, and you do not have to project the <m>y</m>-intercept values back to an axis system which is not adjacent to the segment.</p><figure xml:id="ggb_global_local">

<title>Relation Between Loading, Shear and Moment</title>


<p>Suppose that we have a simply supported beam upon which there is an applied load <m>w(x)</m> which is distributed on the beam by some function of position, <m>x</m>, as shown in <xref ref="arbitrary_load_nn"/>.</p><figure xml:id="arbitrary_load_nn">

<p>Apply force equilibrium in the vertical direction gives allows us to make the following derivation:</p>
<p><md><mrow>\sum F_y\amp=0</mrow><mrow>V+w(\Delta x)-(V+\Delta V)\amp=0</mrow><mrow>\frac {\Delta V}{\Delta x}\amp=w</mrow><mrow>\lim_{\Delta x \to\ 0} \frac {\Delta V}{\Delta x}\amp\Rightarrow \frac {dV}{dx}=w</mrow></md></p>
<p/>
<p>This final equation tells us that, at a given location, the slope of the shear V is the value of the loading <m>w</m>. Furthermore, if we multiply both sides by <m>dx</m>, we can integrate to find that </p>
<p><me>\Delta V=\int w\ dx</me></p>
<p/>
<p>In words, this equation says that over a given distance, the change in the shear <m>V</m> is the area under the loading curve, <m>w</m>.</p>
<p>Now looking at the internal bending moments on the <acro>FBD</acro> in <xref ref="arbitrary_slice_oo"/>, when we apply moment equilibrium about the centroid <m>G</m> of the element:</p>
<p><md><mrow>\sum M_G \amp =0</mrow><mrow>-\frac {\Delta x}{2}V-\frac {\Delta x}{2}(V+\Delta V)-M+(M+\Delta M)\amp=0</mrow><mrow>\frac {\Delta M}{\Delta x}\amp=\frac{1}{2}(2V+\Delta V)</mrow><mrow>\lim_{\Delta x \to\ 0} \frac {\Delta M}{\Delta x}\amp\Rightarrow \frac {dM}{dx}=V</mrow></md></p>
<p/>
<p>This final equation tells us that, the slope of the moment diagram is the value of the shear. Furthermore, if we multiply both sides by <m>dx</m>, we can integrate to find that </p>
<p><me>\Delta M=\int V\ dx</me></p>
<p/>
<p>In words, this equation says that over a given segment, the change in the moment value is the area under the shear curve.</p>

<p><ol><li>
<p>First, <alert>determine the reaction forces</alert> and moments by drawing a free body diagram of the entire beam and applying the equilibrium equations. Double check that your reactions are correct.</p></li><li>
<p>Establish the shear graph with a horizontal axis below the beam and a vertical axis to represent shear. Positive shears will be plotted above the <m>x</m>axis and negative below.</p></li><li>
<p>Make vertical lines at all the <q>interesting points</q>, <ie/> points where concentrated forces or moments act on the beam and at the beginning and end of any distributed loads. This divides the beam into segments between vertical lines.</p></li><li>
<p><alert>Draw the shear diagram</alert> by starting with a dot at <m>x = 0</m>, <m>V = 0</m> then proceeding from left to right until you reach the end of the beam. Choose and label a scale which keeps the diagram a reasonable size. <ol><li>
<p>Whenever you encounter a concentrated force, jump up or down by that value.</p></li><li>
<p>Whenever you encounter a concentrated moment, do not jump.</p></li><li>
<p>Whenever you encounter a distributed load, move up or down by the <q>area</q> under the loading curve over the length of the segment, according to equation 2. The <q>area</q> is actually a force.</p></li><li>
<p>The slope of the curve at each point <m>x</m> is given by equation 1. Distributed loads cause the shear diagram to have a slope equal to the negative value of the load at that point. For unloaded segments of the beam, the slope is zero, i.e. the shear curve is horizontal. For segments with uniformly distributed load, the slope is constant.</p></li><li>
<p>The shear diagram should start and end at <m>V = 0</m>. If it doesn’t, recheck your work.</p></li></ol></p></li><li>
<p> Add another interesting point wherever the shear diagram crosses the <m>x</m>-axis, and determine the <m>x</m> position of the zero crossing.</p></li><li>
<p>After you have completed the shear diagram, <alert>calculate the area under the shear</alert> curve for each segment. Areas above the axis are positive, areas below the axis are negative. The areas represent moments and the sum of the areas plus the values of any concentrated moments should add to zero. If they don’t, then recheck your work.</p></li><li>
<p>Establish the moment graph with a horizontal axis below the shear diagram and a vertical axis to represent moment. Positive moments will be plotted above the x-axis and negative below.</p></li><li>
<p><alert>Draw and label dots on the moment diagram</alert> by starting with a dot at <m>x = 0, M = 0</m> then proceed from left to right placing dots until you reach the end of the beam. As you move over each segment move up or down from the current value by the <q>area</q> under the shear curve for that segment and place a dot on the graph. In this step, you are applying equation 4. <ol><li>
<p>Positive areas cause the moment to increase, negative areas cause it to decrease.</p></li><li>
<p>If you encounter a concentrated moment, jump straight up or down by the amount of the moment and place a dot. Clockwise moments cause upward jumps and counterclockwise moments cause downward jumps.</p></li><li>
<p>When you reach the end of the beam you should return to <m>M = 0</m>. If you don’t, then recheck your work.</p></li></ol></p></li><li>
<p><alert>Connect the dots with correctly shaped lines</alert>. Segments under constant shear are straight lines, segments under changing shear are curves. The general curvature of the lines can be determined by considering equation 3.</p></li></ol></p></subsubsection><conclusion>
<p>Every shear and bending moment diagram problem should include:
<ol><li>A neat, accurate, labeled free body diagram of the entire structure, and the work to find the reactions. For this work, you may replace the distributed loads with equivalent concentrated loads.</li><li>A neat, properly scaled diagram of the beam showing its reactions and <q>true</q> loads.

<title>Calculus Method</title>

<introduction>
<p>In <xref ref="VM_relations_cc"/> we learned that loading, shear and bending moments are related by integral and differential equation, and used this knowledge to draw shear and bending moment diagram suing a graphical approach.  This method is easy and fast in cases when you can easily calculate the areas under the loading and shear curves without integration.</p>
<p>However, there are times that the graphical technique falls short when the areas are more complicated than rectangles or triangles. For example, a uniformly varying load, which is a 1st-degree linear function of <m>x</m>, integrates to a 2nd-degree parabolic shear function, and a 3rd degree cubic moment function.  To use the graphical method you will need to find the area under the parabolic shear curve to compute the cubic moment.   When the loading becomes more complex it is better to use perform the integration directly. </p>
<p>We use the same fundamental equations in this section as you used in the graphical method </p>
<p><md><mrow>\Delta V\amp =\int w(x) dx \amp \Delta M \amp=\int V dx</mrow></md></p>
<p>But, instead of finding areas and slopes you will obtain an equation for the load as a function of <m>x</m>, then integrate it to find the shear function. The  integral equations are the change in the shear and moment, thus you will need starting values for each segment. </p>
<p>The starting values come from either the ending value of the previous segment or point loads or point moments. Because of the requirement for these segment starting values, no segment can be computed in isolation from the other segments. Physically this means that the shear and moment along a beam are not just due to the loading in one segment, but are related to the loading on the rest of the beam as well.</p><table>

<title>Conclusion</title>


<p>You have likely realized that in engineering (and life) that there are multiple ways to solve a problem. The four different techniques in this chapter to compute internal loadings are a demonstration of this. </p>
<p>The table below may help you consider the advantages and disadvantages of each method. In the end, the decision of which method to useis yours, and the better you know each method the easier it will be to choose the one which is both applicable and efficient.</p><table>
