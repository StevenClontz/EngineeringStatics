<title> What is Engineering Statics?</title>


<p>Engineering Statics, hereafter shortened to Statics, is the gateway course into the rest of engineering mechanics, which is the application of mechanics to solve problems involving common engineering elements.</p>
<p>The types of problems you will learn to solve in Statics include:</p>
<p><ol><li>Find the tension of two and three-dimensional rope support systems,</li><!-- todo [diagram of 2D rock climbing anchors and 3D ??] --><li>Determine the support forces/ moments between your chair and the floor, plus computing the interaction forces/moments between the separate parts of the chair,</li><!-- todo [chair diagram or photos] --><li>Find the center of mass and centroid for a non-uniform shape, and compute how the distribution of the material in a beam cross-section makes the beam stiffer,</li><!-- todo[add image of I beam 4x stiffer than a sandwich beam?] --><li>Compute the angle at which you could push a box up a ramp and whether the box would slide or tip,</li><!-- todo [add image of slipping or tipping] --><li> Compute the internal loads in the beam of a bridge.</li></ol></p>
<p>The name <term>Statics</term> refers to the fact that the main focus of this course is solving problems related to particles or rigid bodies that are in equilibrium (and hence are not moving, static). Beyond this introductory chapter, this book will move into the basic principles and mathematical operations of force and position vectors (<xref ref="Chapter_02"/>). Then you will have an opportunity to practice these vector principles on particle equilibrium problems (<xref ref="Chapter_03"/>). Next, we’ll focus on the rotational tendency of forces, called moments (which is the same as torque in <xref provisional="Chapter_04"/>).  In <xref provisional="Chapter_05"/>, we’ll introduce the concept of balance of forces and moments, known as equilibrium. Then in <xref provisional="Chapter_06"/>, you will be expanding your knowledge of equilibrium to include various multi-body trusses, frames, and machines. In <xref provisional="Chapter_07"/>, we will divert from equilibrium to focus on finding the center of mass and area moment of inertia for shapes. <xref provisional="Chapter_08"/> is the only part of Statics which looks at the internal (vs. external) forces and moments. <xref provisional="Chapter_09"/> expands equilibrium to include various types of friction forces. Finally, <xref provisional="Chapter_10"/> provisional an alternate equilibrium methodology called virtual work. Your Statics course may not cover all of these topics, or choose to move through them in a different order.</p>
<p>The knowledge gained in Statics will then flow into other engineering mechanics topics of Dynamics, Mechanics of Solids (also commonly called Mechanics of Materials), and Fluids. For many of you, Statics will be one of the most foundational engineering courses of your academic career. </p>
<p>We will build upon your knowledge gained in the prerequisite courses of Physics I and Calculus I. Later in this chapter, you can find the specifics of the topics/skills we will expect that you have brought with you into Statics from these prerequisite courses and your life experience.</p><figure>

<title>Newton’s Laws of Motion</title>

<introduction>
<p>Before jumping into Sir Isaac Newton’s Laws of Motion, let us quickly talk about motion itself. Motion can be separated into two types:</p>
<p><ul><li><term>translation</term>: when a body changes position without rotating and </li><li><term>rotation</term>: the spinning of a body about an axis.</li></ul></p>
<p>Some moving bodies are purely translating or rotating, many are doing both. Conveniently, we can often isolate the translation and rotation of a body into separate equations as you will see related to Newton’s 2nd Law below.</p></introduction><subsection xml:id="newtons-first-law">

<title>Newton's 1st Law</title>


<p>Newton's first law states that an object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force.</p><paragraphs xml:id="newtons-first-law-application-to-translational-motion">

<title>Application to Translational Motion</title>


<p>This law, also sometimes called the "law of inertia", means that bodies maintain their current velocity unless a force is applied to change that velocity. In other words, if an object is at rest it will remain at rest until the resultant force (or net sum of forces) is out of equilibrium and changes the velocity, and if an object is moving at a constant velocity (which includes both speed and direction), it will remain at that same velocity until a force begins to change the velocity.</p>
<p/>

<p/>
<p>Figure XX: This rock is at rest with zero velocity and will remain at rest until a net force causes the rock to move. The net force on the rock is the sum of any force pushing the rock and the friction force of the ground on the rock opposing that force.

<title>Application to Rotational Motion</title>


<p>Newton's first law also applies to moments and rotational velocities. A moment (or torque)  is the rotational tendency of a force and you will learn much more about moments in Ch 4.  A body will maintain its current rotational velocity until a moment is exerted to change that rotational velocity. This can be seen in things like toy tops, flywheels, stationary bikes, and other objects that will continue spinning once started until friction, brakes or a moment either speeds up or slows down the spinning motion.</p>
<p/>
<p>Figure XX: In the absence of friction, this spinning top would continue to spin forever, but the small frictional moment exerted at the point of contact between the top and the ground will slow the tops spinning over time.

<title>Newton's 2nd Law</title>


<p>Newton's second law states that a particle accelerates in the direction of and at a rate proportional to the net applied force.</p><paragraphs xml:id="newtons-second-law-application-to-translational-motion">

<title>Application to Translational Motion</title>


<p>For translational motion, Newton’s 2nd law can be depicted by the equation </p>
<p><men xml:id="f-ma"> \Sigma\vec{F}=m\vec{a} </men></p>
<p>You will notice that the force and the acceleration in the equation above are are typeset in bold. This means that they are vector quantities, having both a magnitude and a direction. Mass on the other hand is a <em>scalar</em> quantity, which has only a magnitude. Both the definition and equation reflect that the magnitude of the net force is proportional to the acceleration of an object and the direction of the net force also dictates the acceleration direction of the object.</p></paragraphs><paragraphs xml:id="newtons-second-law-application-to-rotational-motion">

<title>Application to Rotational Motion</title>


<p>Newton's second law states that the sum of moments on an object will be proportional to angular acceleration <m>\vec{\alpha} </m>of the object. The proportionality constant is what is known as the mass moment of inertia of the object (I). In equation form this is:</p>
<p><md><mrow>\Sigma\vec{M}=I\vec{\alpha}</mrow></md></p>
<p>Notice that the moment and the angular acceleration are vector quantities (given the arrow notation) and thus have both a magnitude and direction. The mass moment of inertia, on the other hand, is a scalar quantity and has only a magnitude. Vectors and scalars will be covered in more detail in <xref ref="Chapter_02"/>.</p></paragraphs></subsection><subsection xml:id="newtons-third-law">

<title>Newton's 3rd Law</title>


<p>Newton's Third Law states "For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction." </p>
<p>The primary action Newton is referring to are forces, so for every force one body exerts on another body, the second body exerts a force of equal magnitude and opposite direction back on the first body. Since all forces are exerted by bodies (either directly or indirectly), all forces come in pairs, one acting on each of the bodies interacting.</p>
<p/>
<p>Figure XX: The gravitational pull of the earth and moon represent interacting bodies where the earth exerts a gravitational force on the moon, and the moon exerts an equal and opposite force on the earth.</p>
<p>Though there may be two equal and opposite forces acting on a single body, it is important to remember that for interacting bodies, each of the forces acts on a separate body. This can sometimes be confusing when there are multiple interacting bodies. The trick for these multi-body systems (as discussed in the creation of Free Body Diagrams in Ch 3 and Ch 5, is to isolate the body or system which exposes the forces you wish to solve for.</p>
<p>[add figure of your physics book sitting on a table (or a box?), draw FBD of book + table and separate FBD of book alone]</p>
<p>Figure XX: We use FBD’s to expose the forces we want to solve for in a problem. If you wanted to solve for the forces on the legs of the table, we would use FBD (a) as it includes those forces. Notice that FBD (a) does not include the interaction forces between the book and table. However, when the book is isolated in FBD (b) and (c) we can see that the equal and opposite interaction forces between the book and table are exposed.</p></subsection></section><section xml:id="Chapter_01-unit-systems">

<title>Unit Systems</title>


<p>The magnitude of a vector needs to also have units associated with it. You will recall from Physics that there are two primary unit systems. The International System of Units (SI, abbreviated from the French <foreign>Système international (d'unités)</foreign> is the modern form of the metric system and is the most widely used system of measurement. It comprises a coherent system of units of measurement built on seven base units, which are the second, meter, kilogram, ampere, kelvin, mole, candela. We will only use units a second, meter, and kilogram in Statics. The prefixes to the unit names specify the base-10 multiple of the original unit.  </p>
<p>The United States customary units are a system of measurements commonly used in the United States. The United States customary system developed from English units which were in use in the British Empire before the U.S. became an independent country. However, the United Kingdom's system of measures was overhauled in 1824 to create the imperial system, changing the definitions of some units. Therefore, while many U.S. units are essentially similar to their Imperial counterparts, there are significant differences between the systems. The standard units for time, distance, and mass in Statics are a second, foot, and slug. Note that this text does not use pounds mass, instead opting to use slugs for all US customary units masses and avoiding the pounds mass vs. pounds-force confusion. </p>
<p>The magnitude of a force is measured in units of mass [m] times length [L] divided by time [t] squared [<m>F=\text{m L}/\text{t}^2</m>]. In metric units, the most common force unit is the newton [N] where one newton is a kilogram multiplied by a meter per second squared. This means that a one-newton force would cause a one-kilogram object to accelerate at a rate of one-meter-per-second-squared, or in more familiar terms, a newton weighs about a quarter pound. In English units, the most common unit is the pound-force [<m>\lbf{}</m>], or pound [lb] for short, where one pound is the force which can accelerate a mass of one slug at one foot per second squared.  It is worth noting that many physics texts use pounds mass [<m>\lbm{}</m>] exclusively instead of slugs (where  <m>\lbm{32.174}</m> = <m>\slug{1}</m>). This text will use slugs as they are the standard mass unit in U. S. customary system and they have a parallel use to kilograms in the SI system. </p>
<p>Thus looking at the units of forces across the unit systems we can show:</p>
<p>General definition: <m>\text{force} = \dfrac{[\text{mass}] \cdot [\text{distance}]}{[\text{time}^2]}</m></p>
<p>SI Units: <m>\text{1 Newton}=\dfrac{[\text{kg}]\cdot[\text{m}]}{[\text{s}^2]}</m></p>
<p>US Customary Units: <m>\text{1 pound}=\dfrac{[\text{slug}]\cdot[\text{ft}]}{[\text{s}^2]}</m></p>
<p>Note that when you are relating the weight to the mass of an object, that you are actually applying Newton’s Second Law (<m>\Sigma\vec{F}=m\vec{a}</m>) as seen in <xref ref="units_table"/> below.</p><table xml:id="units_table">

<title>Types of Forces</title>


<p>Statics is a course about forces and we will have a lot to say about them.  At its simplest, a force is a 'push or pull', but forces come from a variety of sources and and occur in many different situations.  As such we need a specialized vocabulary to talk about them.   We are also interested in forces which cause rotation, and we have special terms to describe these too.  These specialized terms will be used in Statics and other engineering courses to follow.</p><figure xml:id="block_forces">

<caption>Forces acting on a box on a rough surface being pulled by a cable attached to one face.</caption>

<image source="images/block_forces.png" width="75%"/></figure>
<p/>
<p>This figure shows a few of the types of loads used in Statics and other Engineering Mechanics courses.  For computational simplicity, we often will find point forces which are equivalent to surface and body forces. Loads like this as well as others will show up in this course.</p><paragraphs xml:id="force-types-weight">

<title>Weight</title>


<p><term>Weight</term> is the force acting on an object due to the gravitational attraction of the earth on the object's mass.  The direction of the weight vector is down – towards the center of the earth.  Sometimes the term weight simply means the magnitude of the weight vector,  such as when you stand on a scale to read your weight.</p>
<p>If the mass of an object is known, <xref ref="f-ma" text="custom">Newton's 2nd law</xref> can be used to find its weight by multiplying the mass by the local acceleration of gravity, <m>g</m>. On the surface of the earth <m>g</m> can be taken to be <m>\aSI{9.81}</m> in the SI System.  The same object taken to the moon will weigh less because the local value of <m>g</m> there is only about one sixth the value it has on earth, and in space, where <m>g</m> is approximately zero the same object will be 'weightless.'</p>
<p><mdn><mrow> \vec{W} \amp = m \vec{g} \amp (\text{vector})</mrow><mrow> W \amp =m g \amp (\text{scalar})</mrow></mdn></p>
<p>Take care when using these equations to consider the units and the difference between mass and force.  A 5 pound bag of sugar weighs <m>\lb5}</m>, but a <m>\kg{ 1 }</m> bag of flour weighs <m>\N{9.8}</m> which incidentally is equivalent to <m>\lb{2.2}</m>.  In this book we will rarely switch between systems of units like this.  You are advised to stick with whichever system of units used in the problem statement.</p></paragraphs><paragraphs xml:id="point-forces">

<title>Point Forces</title>


<p><term>Point forces</term> are forces which act at a single point.  This is an idealization which is physically impossible, but is useful to simplify situation none the less.  Examples would be a rope pulling on a block or the cable that suspends a wrecking ball. As point forces are the easiest to deal with computationally, we will provide you tools throughout this course which allow you to turn surface and body forces into point forces.</p></paragraphs><paragraphs xml:id="force-types-distributed-forces">

<title>Distributed Forces</title>


<p><term>Distributed force</term> is the generic name we use to include line forces, surface forces and body forces.  These are similar in that they represent forces distributed over lines, surfaces, and volumes respectively.</p>
<p>Dealing with three-dimensional spatially distributed forces is pretty complicated, so we typically simplify a distributed force into an equivalent point force (as shown in <xref provisional="distributed forces"/>).</p></paragraphs><paragraphs xml:id="force-types-line-forces">

<title>Line Forces</title>


<p><term>Line forces</term> are forces which are spread out or distributed over a line.  Line forces have units of force per unit length.  As an example, paperback books weigh about <m>\lbperft{6}</m> while textbooks weight more like <m>\lbperft{20--25}</m>,</p></paragraphs><paragraphs xml:id="surface-forces">

<title>Surface Forces</title>


<p><term>Surface forces</term> are forces distributed over a surface, and have units of force per unit area.  Pressure is an example of a surface force, as is the weight of an object spread out over the surface it rests on and the friction force when a block slides across a rough surface .</p>
<p><xref ref="block_forces"/> shows the forces acting on a box being pulled across a rough surface. While both the weight and friction forces are distributed across the same surface, they actually act in different directions. The support forces are <em>normal</em> (or perpendicular) to the contacting surface, while friction forces are parallel to the contacting surface. </p>
<p>In <xref provisional="distributed forces"/>, we will describe how to find the equivalent point force to a surface (or distributed) force.</p></paragraphs><paragraphs xml:id="body-forces">

<title>Body Forces</title>


<p><term>Body forces</term> are forces which are distributed throughout a three-dimensional body. </p>
<p>The most important body force is the weight of an object, but other body forces include buoyancy and forces caused by gravitational, electric, and magnetic fields. </p>
<p>Weight and buoyancy will be the only body force we consider in Statics. In many situations, these forces are small in comparison to the loads acting on the object, and as such they may be neglected.  The decision to neglect forces must be made on the basis of sound engineering judgement, however in this course you should consider the weight in your analysis if a problem statement provides enough information to determine the force, otherwise you may ignore it. </p>
<p>Remember that mass = density time volume.</p>
<p><men> m \amp = \rho V \amp (\text{Constant density})</men></p>
<p>As shown in <xref provisional="Chapter_07"/>, for computational simplicity we often model a body’s weight as a single equivalent point force acting through the center of mass of the body.</p></paragraphs><paragraphs xml:id="force-types-concentrated-forces">

<title>Concentrated Forces</title>


<p><term>Concentrated forces</term> are used to represent and simplify distributed forces by treating them as point forces, in order to simplify the mathematical analysis.  The effects of the distributed force is 'concentrated' to a single point, in such a was that it that the external effect on the body is unchanged. </p></paragraphs><paragraphs xml:id="force-types-load-forces">

<title>Load Forces</title>


<p>Generally speaking, designed objects are designed to hold things up or hold things together.  <term>Load forces</term>, or simply loads, are the forces which the object must support or transmit in order to do its job: think the weight of vehicles driving across a bridge, the wind blowing on a building, the pressure in a pressure vessel, or the torque of an engine on a drive shaft.  </p></paragraphs><paragraphs xml:id="force-types-reaction-forces">

<title>Reaction Forces</title>


<p>Forces and couple-moments that come from supports that hold or constrain an object or mechanical system in equilibrium are called the <term>reaction forces</term> or the reactions.  These are called the reactions because they react or respond when other forces acting on the system change.</p>
<p>Reaction forces are introduced in <xref ref="Chapter_03"/> and reaction couples are introduced in <xref provisional="chapter 5"/>.</p></paragraphs><paragraphs xml:id="force-types-resultant-forces">

<title>Resultant Forces</title>


<p>A <term>resultant</term> force is the sum of two or more component forces.  Forces, of course, must be added using the rules of vector addition, and the resultant force may be zero or non-zero.   In an equilibrium situation, if you have included all the forces acting on an object in your sum, the resultant will equal zero.  Vector addition will be introduced in <xref ref="Chapter_03"/> and used throughout the course.</p></paragraphs><paragraphs xml:id="force-types-component-forces">

<title>Component Forces</title>


<p>A force may be considered to be the vector sum of two or more other forces.  These forces are called the <em>components</em>, and the force that they add up to is called the <em>resultant</em>.</p></paragraphs><paragraphs xml:id="force-types-interaction-forces">

<title>Interaction Forces</title>


<p><term>Interaction forces</term> and couple-moments caused by the connection of one body with all the others it touches.  <xref ref="newtons-third-law" text="title"/> tells us that interaction forces always occur in pairs (action-reaction), and it is important in this course to be clear which of these forces is which.</p>
<p>Interaction forces and couples are introduced in <xref provisional="Chapter 6"/> when you start dealing with multi-body systems.</p></paragraphs><paragraphs xml:id="force-types-axial-forces">

<title>Axial Forces</title>


<p><term>Axial forces</term> are forces which act along the long, or 'axial,' direction of an object.</p>
<p>Axial forces will be introduced in <xref ref="Chapter_03"/>.</p></paragraphs><paragraphs xml:id="force-types-internal-forces">

<title>Internal Forces</title>


<p><term>Internal forces</term> and moments occur inside bodies and include axial forces, shear forces, and bending moments.  Internal forces are the forces which hold parts of an object together.</p>
<p> Shear forces and bending moments are the focus of <xref provisional="Chapter_08"/>.</p></paragraphs><paragraphs xml:id="force-types-friction-forces">

<title>Friction Forces</title>


<p><term>Friction forces</term> are the forces which prevent or retard motion due to the microscopic roughness of two surfaces in contact with each other.  Friction will be studied  in <xref provisional="friction section"/></p></paragraphs><paragraphs xml:id="force-types-normal-forces">

<title>Normal Forces</title>


<p><term>Normal forces</term> are normal in the sense of perpendicular, and refer to distributed forces acting perpendicular to a surface.  The force of water behind a dam acts normal to the face of the dam.</p></paragraphs><paragraphs xml:id="force-types-shear-forces">

<title>Shear Forces</title>


<p><term>Shear forces</term> refer to forces which act parallel to a surface and are so-called because they create a shearing action.   Scissors (also called shears) creates shear forces on the thickness of a piece of paper when one blade pushes down as the other pushes up.  </p></paragraphs><paragraphs xml:id="force-types-applied-forces">

<title>Applied Forces</title>


<p><term>Applied forces</term> are a type of load which we apply to an object, and presumably control.  The weight being lifted by a crane is an example of an applied force, while the weight of the crane's boom is not.</p></paragraphs><paragraphs xml:id="force-types-moments">

<title>Moments</title>


<p>A <term>moment</term> is a turning action, often created by applying a force to an object at one location in order to rotate it about another point.  When you use a wrench to loosen a nut, your pull on the wrench handle creates a moment which acts on the nut.  Since in this course, most objects are stationary, we say that a moment produces a 'tendency to rotate' rather than produce an actual rotation. </p>
<p>Moments are not forces, but they are vector quantities, so they have both magnitude and direction.  Moments have units of force times distance, like <m>\ftlb{}</m> or <m>\nm{}</m>.</p>
<p>Moments will be discussed in <xref provisional="Chapter_05"/>.</p></paragraphs><paragraphs xml:id="force-types-torques">

<title>Torques</title>


<p><term>Torque</term> is probably a term you are familiar with from physics, where you learn that torques produce angular accelerations (<m>\vec{\tau}= I \{\alpha}</m>) in the same way that forces produce linear acceleration (<m>\vec{F} = m\vec{a}</m>).  </p>
<p>Since in Statics, both linear and angular accelerations equal zero, we use the term Moment instead of torque.  Practically speaking they are synonymous. </p></paragraphs><paragraphs xml:id="force-types-couples">

<title>Couples</title>


<p><term>Couple</term> is the word we use for two equal and opposite forces which cause a turning action or twist.  A couple produces a moment.</p></paragraphs><paragraphs xml:id="force-types-couple-moments">

<title>Couple-moments</title>


<p>A couple-moment is a concentrated rotational twist (or torque) on a body. A couple-moment may be the result of single force or a complex combination of forces, and couples. It is often advantageous to simplify a complex situation by reducing it to a single concentrated force and a couple-moment. </p></paragraphs></section><section xml:id="Chapter_01-prerequisite-topics">
