<title>Introduction</title>


<p>This chapter lays the groundwork for the course. You will be reminded and asked to recall many of the things you have learned in previous prerequisite courses. Don’t worry if a few of the topics covered are a bit rusty, that is why we are taking some time to cover the basics</p><paragraphs>

<title>What is Engineering Statics?</title>


<p>Engineering Statics (hereafter shortened to Statics) is the gateway course into the rest of engineering mechanics, which is the application of Newtonian physics to design and analyze objects, systems, and structures with respect to motion, deformation, and/or failure. One of the main ways you will develop skills and knowledge in the area of mechanics is through the practice of solving problems.</p></paragraphs>
<p>The name <q>Statics</q> refers to the fact that the main focus of this course is solving problems related to particles or rigid bodies that are in equilibrium (and hence the loads acting upon them are balanced). The chapters in this book cover:</p>
<p><dl><li>

<p>We will build upon your knowledge gained in the prerequisite courses of Physics I and Calculus I.

<title>Newton’s Laws of Motion</title>

<objectives><introduction>
<p>Key Questions:</p></introduction><ul><li>What three relationships do Newton’s laws of motion define?</li><li>What are physical examples for each of Newton’s three laws of motion?</li></ul></objectives><subsection xml:id="newtons-laws-introduction">

<title>Introduction</title>


<p>Before jumping into Sir Isaac Newton’s Laws of Motion, let us quickly talk about motion itself. Motion can be separated into two types:</p>
<p><dl><li>

<title>translation</title>


<p>when a body changes position without rotating, and</p></li><li>

<title>rotation</title>


<p>the spinning of a body about an axis.</p></li></dl></p>
<p>Some moving bodies are purely translating or rotating, many are doing both. Conveniently, we can often isolate the translation and rotation of a body into separate equations as you will see related to Newton’s 2nd Law below.</p></subsection><subsection xml:id="newtons-first-law">

<title>Newton's 1st Law</title>

<introduction>
<p>Newton's first law states that an object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external load.</p></introduction><subsubsection xml:id="newtons-first-law-application-to-translational-motion-">

<title>Application to Translational Motion </title>


<p>This law, also sometimes called the <q>law of inertia,</q> means that bodies maintain their current velocity unless a force is applied to change that velocity. In other words, if an object is at rest it will remain at rest until the resultant force (or net sum of forces) is out of equilibrium and changes the velocity, and if an object is moving at a constant velocity (which includes both speed and direction), it will remain at that same velocity until a force begins to change the velocity.</p><sidebyside widths="50% 30%">

<p>In the absence of friction in space, this space capsule will maintain its current velocity until some outside force causes that velocity to change.</p></sidebyside></subsubsection><subsubsection xml:id="newtons-first-law-application-to-rotational-motion-">

<title>Application to Rotational Motion </title>


<p>Newton's first law also applies to moments and rotational velocities. A moment (or torque)  is the rotational tendency of a force and you will learn much more about moments in <xref ref="Chapter_04"/>.  A body will maintain its current rotational velocity until a moment (applied torque) is exerted to change that rotational velocity. This can be seen in things like toy tops, flywheels, stationary bikes, and other objects that will continue spinning once started until brakes or a moment either speeds up or slows down the spinning motion.</p>

<title>Newton's 2nd Law</title>

<introduction>
<p>Newton's second law states that a particle accelerates in the direction of and at a rate proportional to the net applied force.</p></introduction><subsubsection xml:id="newtons-second-law-application-to-translational-motion">

<title>Application to Translational Motion</title>


<p>For translational motion, Newton’s 2nd law can be depicted by the equation <men>\Sigma\vec{F}= m\vec{a}</men></p>
<p>You will notice that the force and the acceleration are in bold face. This means that they are vector quantities, having both a magnitude and a direction. Mass on the other hand is a scalar quantity, which has only a magnitude. Both the definition and equation reflect that the magnitude of the net force is proportional to the acceleration of an object and the direction of the net force also dictates the acceleration direction of the object. As all the bodies in Statics are subject to a balance of forces <m>\Sigma \vec{F}=0</m> it turns out that the linear acceleration <m>\vec{a}</m> will be equal to zero. Therefore, all bodies having no acceleration will either be at rest or remain at a constant velocity.</p></subsubsection><subsubsection xml:id="newtons-second-law-application-to-rotational-motion">

<title>Application to Rotational Motion</title>


<p>Newton's second law states that the sum of moments on an object will be proportional to angular acceleration <m>\vec{\alpha}</m> of the object. The proportionality constant is what is known as the <term>mass moment of inertia</term> of the object. In equation form this is: <men>\Sigma \vec{M} =I \vec{\alpha}</men></p>
<p>Notice that the moment and the angular acceleration are vector quantities and thus have both a magnitude and direction. The mass moment of inertia, on the other hand, is a scalar quantity and has only a magnitude. Vectors and scalars will be covered in more detail in <xref ref="Chapter_02"/>. As all the bodies in Statics are subject to a balance of moments <m>\Sigma \vec{M}=0</m>, in addition to a balance of forces, it turns out that the angular acceleration <m>\vec{\alpha}</m> also must be equal to zero. Therefore all bodies in equilibrium are either at rest or remain at a constant angular velocity.</p></subsubsection></subsection><subsection xml:id="newtons-third-law">

<title>Newton's 3rd Law</title>


<p>Newton's Third Law states <q>For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.</q></p>
<p>The primary action Newton is referring to is a force and every force in existence comes from one body’s interaction with another body. Therefore every force on a body has an equal and opposite force which is acting on another body.  </p><sidebyside widths="30% 50%"><image source="images/earthmoon.png"/>
<p>The gravitational pull of the earth and moon represent interacting bodies where the earth exerts a gravitational force on the moon, and the moon exerts an equal and opposite force on the earth.</p></sidebyside>
<p/>
<p>Though there may be two equal and opposite forces acting on a single body, it is important to remember that for interacting bodies, each of the forces acts on a separate body. This can sometimes be confusing when there are multiple interacting bodies. The way to solve these multi-body systems (as discussed in the creation of Free Body Diagrams in <xref ref="Chapter_03"/> and <xref ref="Chapter_05"/>), is to isolate the body or system which exposes the forces you wish to solve for.</p><figure xml:id="table_book">

<caption>
This is an example of how free-body diagrams are used to expose the forces we want to solve for in a problem. If you wanted to solve for the forces on the legs of the table, we would use FBD (a) as it includes those forces. Notice that the free-body diagram in the middle does not include the interaction forces between the book and table. However, on the right, when the book is isolated, we can see that the equal and opposite interaction forces between the book and the table are exposed.

<title>Units</title>

<objectives><introduction>
<p>Key Questions:</p></introduction><ul><li>How do you convert between different unit formats?</li><li>Do we use pounds-force or pounds-mass in Statics?</li></ul></objectives><paragraphs>

<title/>


<p>The magnitude of a vector needs to also have units associated with it. You will recall from Physics that there are two primary unit systems. The International System of Units (SI, abbreviated from the French <foreign>Système international (d'unités)</foreign> is the modern form of the metric system and is the most widely used system of measurement. It comprises a coherent system of units of measurement built on seven base units, which are the second, meter, kilogram, ampere, kelvin, mole, candela. We will only use units a second, meter, and kilogram in Statics. The prefixes to the unit names specify the base-10 multiple of the original unit.  </p>
<p>The United States customary units are a system of measurements commonly used in the United States. The United States customary system developed from English units which were in use in the British Empire before the U.S. became an independent country. However, the United Kingdom's system of measures was overhauled in 1824 to create the imperial system, changing the definitions of some units. Therefore, while many U.S. units are essentially similar to their Imperial counterparts, there are significant differences between the systems. The standard units for time, distance, and mass in Statics are a second, foot, and slug. Note that this text does not use pounds mass, instead opting to use slugs for all US customary units masses and avoiding the pounds mass vs. pounds-force confusion. </p>
<p>The magnitude of a force is measured in units of mass [m] times length [L] divided by time [t] squared [<m>F=\text{m L}/\text{t}^2</m>]. In metric units, the most common force unit is the newton [N] where one newton is a kilogram multiplied by a meter per second squared. This means that a one-newton force would cause a one-kilogram object to accelerate at a rate of one-meter-per-second-squared. In English units, the most common unit is the pound-force [<m>\lbf{}</m>], or pound [lb] for short, where one pound is the force which can accelerate a mass of one slug at one foot per second squared.  It is worth noting that many physics texts use pounds mass [<m>\lbm{}</m>] exclusively instead of slugs (where  <m>\lbm{32.174}</m> = <m>\slug{1}</m>). This text will use slugs as they are the standard mass unit in U. S. customary system and they have a parallel use to kilograms in the SI system. </p>
<p>Thus looking at the units of forces across the unit systems we can show:</p>
<p><dl><li>

<title>Definition</title>


<p><m>\text{force} = \dfrac{[\text{mass}][\text{distance}]}{[\text{time}^2]}</m></p></li><li>

<title>SI units</title>


<p><m>\text{1 Newton}=\dfrac{[\text{kg}][\text{m}]}{[\text{s}^2]}</m></p></li><li>

<title>US units</title>


<p><m>\text{1 pound}=\dfrac{[\text{slug}][\text{ft}]}{[\text{s}^2]}</m></p></li></dl></p>
<p>Note that when you are relating the weight to the mass of an object, that you are actually applying Newton’s Second Law (<m>\Sigma\vec{F}=m\vec{a}</m>) as seen in <xref ref="units_table"/> below.</p><table xml:id="units_table">

<objectives><introduction>
<p>Key Questions:</p></introduction><ul><li>What are some of the fundamental types of forces used in Statics? </li><li>Why do we often simplify distributed forces with equivalent forces?</li></ul></objectives><paragraphs>

<title/>


<p>Statics is a course about forces and we will have a lot to say about them.  At its simplest, a force is a 'push or pull', but forces come from a variety of sources and occur in many different situations.  As such we need a specialized vocabulary to talk about them. One example of defining forces can be found below in <xref ref="block_forces"/>. We are also interested in forces that cause rotation, and we have special terms to describe these too.  </p>
<p/><figure xml:id="block_forces">

<caption>
As an example of the types of forces you will learn to quantify in Statics, a box sits on a rough surface and is pulled horizontally by a cable. The loading on the box can be represented by four different forces. The cable causes a point force, the normal and friction forces are reaction forces with the rough surface, and the weight is a body force.

<p>The definitions below describe a few of the force types shown in <xref ref="block_forces"/>. Other types of forces will be defined as they are used later in the book.</p></paragraphs><paragraphs>

<title>Point Force</title>


<p>concentrated force acting at a single point.  Examples would be a rope pulling on a block or the cable that suspends a wrecking ball. In reality, point forces are an idealization as all forces are distributed over some amount of area. Since point forces are the easiest to deal with computationally, tools will be provided throughout this course which allows you to turn surface and body forces into point forces.</p></paragraphs><paragraphs>

<title>Reaction Forces</title>


<p>Forces and couple-moments that come from supports that hold or constrain an object or mechanical system in equilibrium are called the reaction forces or the reactions.  These are called the reactions because they react or respond when other forces acting on the system change.</p>
<p>Reaction forces are introduced in <xref ref="Chapter_03"/> and reaction couples are introduced in <xref provisional="chapter 5"/>.</p></paragraphs><paragraphs>

<title>Body Forces</title>


<p>Body forces are forces that are distributed throughout a three dimensional body.</p>
<p>The most important body force is the weight of an object, but other body forces include buoyancy and forces caused by gravitational, electric, and magnetic fields. </p>
<p>Weight and buoyancy will be the only body forces we consider in Statics. In many situations, these forces are small in comparison to the loads acting on the object, and as such, they may be neglected.  The decision to neglect forces must be made on the basis of sound engineering judgment, however in this course, you should consider the weight in your analysis if a problem statement provides enough information to determine the force, otherwise, you may ignore it. </p>
<p>Remember that mass = density times volume. </p>
<p><mdn><mrow> m \amp = \rho V \amp (\text{Constant density})</mrow></mdn></p>
<p>As shown in <xref provisional="Chapter_07"/>, for computational simplicity we often model a body’s weight as a single equivalent point force acting through the center of mass of the body.</p></paragraphs></section><section xml:id="Chapter_01-problem-solving">

<title>Problem Solving</title>

<objectives><introduction>
<p>Key Questions:</p></introduction><ol><li>What are some strategies to practice selecting a tool from your problem-solving toolbox?</li><li>What is the basic problem-solving process for equilibrium?</li></ol></objectives><paragraphs>

<title/>


<p>Problem solving is a dual-layered decision process whereby you first select the correct tool for the job and then apply that tool to solve the problem. Let us further explore an analogy of 1) a task, 2) some hand tools, and 3) a toolbox. Assume you have a hammer and a screwdriver in your toolbox. Learning how to hammer in a nail or drive in a screw is analogous to the type of skills you will learn in each section of this book. But, knowing <em>which</em> tool is most appropriate to use only comes after you master the operation of each tool. Thus, if your task is to sink a nail into a block of wood, you likely find that the screwdriver is not the most efficient tool for the job. In courses like Statics, deciding your strategy, including the process, equations, and assumptions to solve a problem, is like choosing the best tool from the toolbox. Choosing the <em>best</em> tool requires that you consider the capability and efficiency of tools available to you. In your life, you have already learned to select problem-solving tools for a wide array of challenges - from cleaning your dishes to getting to the grocery store. In Statics, we will introduce you to new problem-solving frameworks and techniques. One key consideration when selecting tools is the assumptions inherent in each tool. These assumptions often make use of your prerequisite knowledge and incrementally build to future topics. In Statics, the two fundamental assumptions are that all bodies are rigid (and thus will not break or bend) and in equilibrium. While these two assumptions will not change for the duration of the course, others will become obsolete as you build new skills. One example of this progression is that in <xref ref="Chapter_03"/> you will simplify all bodies to a particle, but in <xref ref="Chapter_05"/> you can expand your knowledge of equilibrium to include rigid bodies and balanced rotation. Note that not all problems can be solved with a single tool, some problems require multiple tools. Only by developing a complete understanding of a tool can you then combine it with others.</p>
<p>Some of the most common statements by students who are struggling in Statics include:</p><blockquote>
<p><q> I didn’t know where to start the problem</q></p>
<p><q>If I only knew which equation to apply, it would be easy for me to solve the problem.</q></p></blockquote>
<p>The message that these students are implying is that they are capable of operating a hammer or screwdriver, but they don’t know <em>which</em> tool to pick out of the toolbox. The best ways to practice deciding on the best strategy include:
<ul label="square"><li>trying a variety of problems selected from across the full range of topics that you have learned and</li><li>comparing and contrasting the various tools so that you know the assumptions, terminology, and application of each tool.</li></ul></p>
<p> Only after becoming fluent within and across topics will your knowledge be complete.</p></paragraphs><paragraphs>

<title>Problem-Solving Steps</title>


<p>In Statics, the majority of the topics focus on equilibrium. The remaining topics are either preparing you for solving equilibrium problems or setting you up with skills that you will use in later classes, like the computation of the moment of inertia. For equilibrium problems, the problem-solving steps are:
<ol><li>Read and understand the problem </li><li>Identify what you are asked to find and what is given.</li><li>Identify and write down a strategy.</li><li>
<p>Apply the strategy to solve for unknowns and check solutions.<ol><li>Create a free-body diagram(s)</li><li>Write equations of equilibrium for the free-body diagram</li><li>Check if the number of equations equals the number of unknowns (if not you may need additional free-body diagrams or other relationships)</li><li>Solve for unknowns and conceptually check solutions</li></ol></p></li></ol></p>
<p>Using these steps does not guarantee that you will get the right solution, but it will help you be critical and conscious of your chosen strategies. This reflection will help you learn more quickly and increase the odds that you choose the right tool for the job. </p></paragraphs></section></chapter>
