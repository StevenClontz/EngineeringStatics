<title>Vectors and Scalars</title>

<introduction>
<p>To solve the various types of problems presented in Statics, you need to use various types of analysis. Some analysis uses scalars, and others require vectors. You were likely introduced to scalars and vectors in a previous math class, but we will spend some time in this chapter to make sure we all are up to speed on the definitions, concepts, and computational tools.</p></introduction><subsection xml:id="Chapter_02-vectors-and-scalars-scalars">

<title>Scalars</title>


<p><term>Scalars</term> are physical quantities described by a positive or negative number, or even zero. Scalar quantities follow the usual laws of algebra. Scalars quantities do not have an associated direction like a vector. Mass, time, speed, and length are all scalars.</p></subsection><subsection xml:id="Chapter_02-vectors-and-scalars-vectors">

<title>Vectors</title>


<p><term>Vectors</term> are physical quantities described by a magnitude and a direction. Examples of vectors we use in Statics include force vectors, position vectors, and moment (torsional) vectors. Computations involving vectors must always consider the directionality of each term and follow the rules of vector algebra. </p>
<p>Let us examine the terminology of a vector. Visualize a vector as an <term>arrow</term>. The <term>tip</term> is the pointed end and the <term>tail</term> the trailing end. As vectors include direction, they operate along a <term>line of action</term>. A line of action can be thought of as an invisible string along which a vector can slide. Sliding a vector along its line of action does not change the vector; thus, it can be a handy tool to simplify vector problems. Refer to the interactive diagram <xref ref="ggb_1d_definitions"/> below.</p>
<p>The <term>vector's magnitude</term> is a positive real number including units, and it describes the 'strength' or 'intensity' of the vector. Graphically we represent a vector's magnitude by the length of its vector arrow.  By itself, a vector's magnitude is a scalar quantity. It makes no sense to speak of a vector with a negative magnitude. Multiplying a vector by -1, produces a vector with the same magnitude but pointing in the opposite direction.   Later we will introduce <term>scalar components</term> as a means of describing vectors.  These are scalar quantities which may be positive or negative which may lead to some confusion.</p>
<p>Vectors can either be either constant or vary as a function of time, position, or something else. For example, if a force varied with time according to the function <m>F(t) = 10t</m> [N] where <m>t</m> is the time in seconds, then the force would be 0 N at <m>t=0</m>, and increase by 10 N each second thereafter.</p><figure xml:id="ggb_1d_definitions">

<p>Test your knowledge of how a vector can change by changing the (1) the magnitude of the vector using the slider, (2) the point of application of the vector by sliding the tail along the line of action, and (3) the direction of the vector by moving the direction of the line of action.</p></instructions></interactive></figure>
<p>Vector directions are described in terms a <term>coordinate system</term>. A coordinate system is an arbitrary reference system used to establish the origin, and the primary directions. You are familiar with the 'Cartesian' coordinate system with mutually perpendicular <m>x</m>, <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> axes and the origin at their intersection point.  Distances are usually measured from the origin, and directions from a primary direction.</p>
<p>One way of describing a vector's direction is to specify its <term>orientation</term> and <term>sense</term>.  Orientation is the angle the vector's line of action makes with a specified reference direction, and sense defines the direction the vector points along its line of action.   A weight vector has a vertical orientation 90Â° from the horizontal axis, with a downward sense. </p>
<p>Another way to represent the direction of a vector is with its <term>unit vector</term>. A unit vector is a vector with a length of one which has the same orientation and sense as a given vector. Hence, a unit vector is a pure direction, as it is independent of the magnitude and unit of measurement of the given vector. Unit vectors are discussed in more detail later in this chapter. </p></subsection><subsection xml:id="Chapter_02-vectors-and-scalars-notation">

<title>Vector Addition </title>


<p>Adding multiple vectors together finds the <term>resultant</term> vector, resultant vectors can be thought of as the 'sum of' or 'combination' of other vectors. To find the resultant vector <m>\vec{R}</m> of two one-dimensional vectors <m>\vec{A}</m>   and  <m> \vec{B}</m> you can simply use the tip-to-tail technique shown in <xref ref="vector_addition_1d"/> below. In the tip-to-tail technique, you slide vector <m>\vec{B}</m> until its tail is at the tip of <m>\vec{A}</m>, and the vector from the tail of <m>\vec{A}</m> to the tip of <m>\vec{B}</m> is the resultant <m>\vec{R}</m>. Note that the resultant <m>\vec{R}</m> is the same when you add <m>\vec{A}</m> onto <m>\vec{B}</m>, so the order of vector addition does not matter and is considered commutative.</p>

<title>Vector Multiplication by a Scalar</title>


<p>Multiplying or dividing a vector by a scalar simply changes the magnitude of the original vector but maintains the original line of action. One of the common transformations we make of vectors is to find the negative of a vector. To find the negative of vector <m>\vec{A}</m>, we would simply multiply <m>\vec{A}</m> by -1, in equation form this looks like:</p>
<p><me>-\vec{A} =(-1) \vec{A} </me></p>
<p>Spatially, when you create a negative vector, you are simply flipping the tip and tail ends. The magnitude, line of action, and orientation stay the same, but the sense flips so now the arrowhead points in the opposite direction. This could be simulated in <xref ref="vector_addition_1d"/> by changing one of the vectors from a positive to a negative value.</p></paragraphs><paragraphs>

<title>Vector Subtraction</title>


<p>The easiest way to handle vector subtraction is to break it into a two-step process where you first take the negative of the vector you are subtracting then add it to the other vector. In this way, you can still use the tip-to-tail technique after flipping the vector you are subtracting. You can also simulate this in <xref ref="vector_addition_1d"/> by following the steps below.
<ol>
<li>Find <m>\vec{A}-\vec{B}</m> where <m>\vec{A}=cm{2}</m> and <m>\vec{B}=\cm{2}</m>.</li>
<li>Set <m>\vec{A}</m> to a value of <m>\cm{2}</m> and <m>\vec{B}</m> to a value of <m>\cm{-3}</m> (the negative of its actual value).</li>
<li>Slide the tail of either vector to find the resultant (or sum) of these two vectors. The order does not matter as vector addition is commutative.</li>
<li>The result should be  <m>\cm{-1}</m>.</li></ol></p></paragraphs></subsection></section><section xml:id="vectors_2d">

<p>The information you learned about one-dimensional vectors serves as a building block for this section. Two dimensional vectors lie in a single geometric plane rather than along a single line. Many of our calculations in Statics are in two dimensions, but the Statics course you are taking may also cover three dimensional systems.</p></introduction><subsection xml:id="Orthogonal_Coordinates">

<title>Orthogonal Coordinate Systems</title>

<introduction>
<p>A coordinate system gives us a frame of reference to describe a system which we would like to analyze.   Orthogonal means <q>perpendicular</q> and in an orthogonal coordinate system each coordinate axis is perpendicular to the others.  The intersection of the coordinate axes is called the origin, and distances to objects are measured from there.</p></introduction><subsubsection xml:id="Cartesian_coords">

<title>Cartesian Coordinates</title>


<p>In Statics the most important coordinate system is the <term>Cartesian</term> system, which was named after the French mathematician RenÃ© Descartes. </p>
<p>In Cartesian coordinates, the three coordinate axes are straight lines named <m>x</m>, <m>y</m> and <m>z</m>. In a two dimensional Cartesian coordinates there is no <m>z</m> direction, and the <m>x</m> axis is usually horizontal and points to the right, and the <m>y</m> axis points vertically upward. In three dimensions the <m>z</m> axis is perpendicular to the other two, and so is also perpendicular to the <m>xy</m> plane.  The positive directions of the axes are selected to make them <q>right handed.</q>  A right-handed coordinate system is one where the <m>x</m> axis rotated into the <m>y</m> axis according to the right-hand rule determines the positive sense for the <m>z</m> axis.</p>
<p>The great benefit of orthogonal coordinate system is that once you separate the components of each vector into parts parallel to the coordinate axes, you can treat the vector components as scalar quantities.  </p>
<p>You are free to orient your coordinate system in any direction you choose as long as it remains a right-hand coordinate system.  </p>
<p>It is usually mathematically advantageous to align one of the coordinate axis with a major feature of the situation.  </p><paragraphs>

<title>Right Hand Rule</title>


<p>The right-hand rule provides a directional relationship between the <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m> axes. Additionally, it establishes the +/- sign convention of rotational vectors like torque or angular velocity. We will discuss the directional relationship between axes here, and the rotational vector will be used extensively in Statics, starting in the Moments and Couples chapter. </p>
<p>You can determine the directional relationship between the <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m> axes in three different ways as shown below in <xref ref="rhr1"/> and <xref ref="rhr2"/>. </p>
<p/><figure xml:id="rhr1">

<title>Alternate Coordinate Systems</title>


<p>Sometimes the geometry of the situation is a poor fit for Cartesian Coordinates, and another system which matches the problem geometry better may be selected in order to reduce mathematical difficulty.</p>
<p>In two dimensions the Polar coordinate system is used for systems with rotational symmetry.  In polar coordinates, a point is located by its distance from the origin <m>r</m>, and an angle measured from a reference direction, <m>\theta</m>, <m>(r,\theta)</m> instead of <m>(x,y)</m>.</p>
<p>In three dimensions Spherical and cylindrical coordinate systems sometimes used and will be discussed in <xref ref="coordinates-3d"/>. </p></paragraphs></subsubsection><subsubsection xml:id="Orthogonal_Coordinates-orthogonal-vector-components">

<title>Orthogonal Vector Components</title>


<p>One of the common first tools to solving problems with vector algebra is to express each vector in terms of its orthogonal components. Using the Cartesian coordinate system, we can describe any two-dimensional vector as the vector sum of its orthogonal components. Hence, for a two-dimensional vector, the Cartesian vector components are the portion of the vector which lies parallel to the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> axes. Using an equation, we can express the Cartesian vector components of <m>\vec{F}</m> as:</p>
<p><men>\vec{F} = \vec{F}_x + \vec{F}_y</men></p><figure xml:id="orthogonal_components">

<p>This interactive shows how you can express any vector as the sum of two orthogonal components using either a horizontal <m>x</m> axis and vertical <m>y</m> axis or rotate the coordinate system to any angle you would like. Recall the axes systems are a tool used to solve problems and the vector <m>\vec{F}</m> does not change when you shift axes systems.  Use the purple and black points to adjust the diagram.</p></instructions></interactive></figure>
<p>The great benefit of finding orthogonal vector components for vector algebra is that each component is then independent of the other components. This independence simplifies our vector algebra computations greatly by allowing us to use independent equations for each orthogonal component direction.</p>
<p/><paragraphs>

<title>Cartesian Unit Vectors</title>


<p>Another way to express the directions of the <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m> axes are with unit vectors.  A unit vector is a vector with a magnitude of one, and no units.  As such, a unit vector represents a pure direction.  It's a vector that points in a certain direction.  By convention a unit vector is indicated by a 'hat' over a vector symbol.  Because they occur frequently, the unit vectors in each of the three Cartesian coordinate directions are their own symbol, which are: 
<ul label="square">
<li>The unit vector pointing in the <m>x</m> direction is <m>\ihat</m>,</li>
<li>The unit vector pointing in the <m>y</m> direction is <m>\jhat</m>, and</li>
<li>The unit vector pointing in the <m>z</m> direction is <m>\khat</m>.</li></ul></p>
<p>If a unit vector is multiplied by a scalar value, the vector is 'scaled' by that amount, so for instance if <m>\ihat</m> is multiplied by  <m>\N{ 100}</m> the result is a <m>\N{100}</m> vector pointing to the right, if <m>\jhat</m> is multiplied by  <m>\N{ -50}</m> the result is a <m>\N{50}</m> vector pointing down.</p></paragraphs></subsubsection></subsection><subsection xml:id="vector_algebra_2D">

<p>There are two ways to graphically add vectors: the Triangle Rule and Parallelogram Rule. Note that in this section we focus on problems where just two vectors are summed to find their resultant. When you need to find the resultant of more than two vectors, it is typically best to use the Algebraic Addition of Components below.
<ul label="square">
<li>For the Triangle Rule, place the tail of one vector at the tip of the other vector, then draw the resultant from the first vector's tail to the final vector's tip. </li>
<li>Next for the Parallelogram Rule, you line up the tails of both vectors, then complete a parallelogram with extension lines parallel to each vector. The resultant is equal to the diagonal from the tails to the opposite corner.</li></ul></p>

<p>Using triangle-based geometry to solve vector problems can be a quick and powerful tool, but includes the following limitations:
<ul label="square">
<li>There are only three sides in a triangle; thus graphical addition is limited to two vectors (and the resultant). You could still draw graphical shapes with three or more vectors to be added but then the shapes become complex polygons.</li>
<li>If you fail to draw the correct vector triangle, you will not find the correct answer. </li>
<li>The trigonometric functions in Table dd above, are all scalar functions. Thus, they are quick ways of solving for the magnitudes of vectors and the angle between vectors, but you would need to complete more analysis if you were asked to find the vector components of an angle from a given datum.</li></ul></p>
<p>If any of these limitations apply to the problem you are trying to solve, never fear, just move onto the next section where you will learn to perform the Algebraic Addition of Components.</p></subsubsection><subsubsection xml:id="vector_algebra_2D-algebraic-addition-of-components">

<title>Algebraic Addition of Components</title>


<p>Recall that previously in Orthogonal Components, we discussed expressing a single vector as the sum of their components. It turns out that if you want the resultant of multiple vectors, they too can be split into components and then added using vector algebra to find the resultant. The steps are as follows:
<ol>
<li>Select a coordinate system</li>
<li>Compute each vector's components using the selected coordinate system</li>
<li>Add together the similar components to find the components of the resultant</li>
<li>Bring the components of the resultant together to express and/or draw your resultant.</li></ol></p>
<p>The use of vector algebra is highly robust. When you are only adding two vectors, Graphical Vector Addition can be more time-efficient.  However, the algebraic addition of components finds the resultant of any number of vectors. </p>
<p>The interactive diagram in <xref ref="addition-2d-views"/>  demonstrates this method. When you move the slider to the  <c>Rectangular Components</c> position you will forces  <m>\vec{A}</m> and <m>\vec{B}</m> resolved into components, which are then added together to find the components of the resultant force <m>\vec{R}</m>. </p></subsubsection><subsubsection xml:id="vector_algebra_2D-vector-subtraction">

<title>Vector Subtraction</title>


<p>Like one-dimensional vector subtraction, the easiest way to handle two dimensional vector subtraction is a combination of taking the negative of a vector followed by vector addition. Multiplying any vector by -1 preserves its magnitude but flips its direction, having the net effect of changing the sign of each scalar component. After flipping the vector you are subtracting, then you can choose any of the above techniques for vector addition.</p></subsubsection></subsection><subsection xml:id="vectors_2d-unit-vectors">

<p>While unit vectors may seem to be a new concept to you, we will demonstrate in this section how you likely have been using unit vector components since you learned your trigonometric identities of sine and cosine.  Let us use the final equivalent equation from <xref ref="notations"/> above: <me>\vec{F}=F \left \langle \cos \theta, \sin \theta \right \rangle </me>.</p>
<p>Now focus on the vector components inside the angled brackets in the equation above. Draw a right triangle with the perpendicular sides horizontal and vertical and a hypotenuse of one. Insert the angle <m>\theta</m> between the horizontal side and the hypotenuse. What equations do you find for the horizontal and vertical sides? You should discover that <m>\cos \theta</m> and <m>\sin \theta</m> are the horizontal and vertical components of the unit vector along <m>\vec{F}</m>. </p>
<p>To further prove this fact, let us look at unit vectors in the context of the Pythagorean Theorem. The Pythagorean Theorem tells us that the sum of the squares of the length of both orthogonal legs of a right triangle must equal the square of the length of the hypotenuse. So, if <m>\cos  \theta</m> and <m>\sin  \theta</m> are the orthogonal components of the unit vector <m>\hat{\vec{F}}</m> and the length of the unit vector is one, then putting these values into the Pythagorean Theorem gives us:</p>
<p><me>\left ( \cos \theta \right )^2 + \left (\sin \theta \right) ^2 = 1^2</me></p>
<p>which can be further simplified to</p>
<p><me>\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1</me></p>
<p>Reflect for a few seconds if the equation above looks familiar. It should ring a bell from your earlier learning in geometry as the equation for a circle with a radius of one unit. Hence, no matter what the angle <m>\theta</m> from a horizontal axis to a line, the terms <m>\cos \theta</m> and <m>\sin \theta</m> make up the components of the unit vector along the line. Note that if the angle <m>\theta</m> is measured from a vertical axis, then the sine and cosine flip, with <m>\sin \theta</m> defining the horizontal component and the <m>\cos\ \theta</m> defining the vertical component of the unit vector. </p></subsubsection><subsubsection xml:id="vectors_2d-unit-vectors-checks-for-unit-vectors">

<title>Checks for Unit Vectors</title>


<p>Given the properties of unit vectors, there are a couple of conceptual checks you can make after computing unit vector components which can save you subsequent errors.
<ol>
<li>All the signs of unit vector components need to match the signs of the original position vector. A unit vector has the same line of action and sense as the position vector but is scaled down to just one unit in magnitude.</li>
<li>Components of a unit vector must be between -1 and 1. If the magnitude of a unit vector is one, then it is impossible for it to have rectangular components larger than one.</li></ol></p></subsubsection></subsection><subsection xml:id="dot_products_2D">

<introduction>
<p>The sections above cover two-dimensional vector addition and subtraction in detail, but vector multiplication requires some additional mathematics. It turns out that there are two different ways to calculate the product of two vectors; one method produces a scalar produce, while the other method results in a vector.
<ul label="square">
<li><term>Dot products</term> are used to compute how much of one vector is <em>parallel</em> to another vector.  This topic will be covered in this section and again in three-dimensional Dot Products.</li>

<title>Dot Products</title>


<p>Dot products project one vector onto another and result in a scalar value. They can use them to find the projection of one vector onto another or the angle between two vectors. Let us go back to our example of the two cables in the interactive in <xref ref="addition-2d-views"/>. If you would like to compute the portion of of tension in cable <m>A</m> which is pulling in the same direction as cable <m>B</m>, known as the projection of <m>\vec{A}</m> onto <m>\vec{B}</m> you could start with the dot product.</p>

<p>In this equation, the bold symbols represent vector quantities, while the corresponding non-bold symbols represent their magnitudes which are scalars. The angle <m>\theta</m> in the equation is the angle between between these two vectors. For the angle <m>\theta</m> between these vectors, you can use either representation shown in <xref ref="ggb_dot_product"/>.</p><figure xml:id="ggb_dot_product">

Before diving into how we will use dot products in Statics, we should emphasize that mathematically dot products are:</p>
<p><ol>
<li>
<p><term>Commutative.</term> The order you dot vectors does not matter</p>
<p><men>\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B} = \vec{B}\cdot\vec{A}</men></p></li>
<li><term>Associative.</term> It does not matter whether you multiply a scalar value a by the final dot product, or either of the individual vectors, you will still get the same answer.

<title>Computation of a Dot Product Using Vector Components </title>


<p>Coming back to our basic dot product equation, we can compute the dot products of unit vectors <m>\ihat</m> and <m>\jhat</m>. The dot product of <m>\ihat</m> and <m>\ihat</m> is:</p>
<p><me>\ihat \cdot \ihat = (1) (1)\cos 0\degree = 1 </me></p>
<p/>
<p>As the length of <m>\ihat</m> is just 1, equation result is dependent on the <m>\cos \theta</m>. Of course, in this case <m>\theta = 0\degree</m> and we know that the <m>\cos 0\degree = 1 </m>.</p>
<p>Similarly, the orthogonal unit vectors <m>\ihat</m> and <m>\jhat</m> are <m>90\degree</m> apart so,</p>
<p><me> \ihat \cdot \jhat = (1) (1)\cos 90\degree  = 0</me></p>
<p/>
<p>Hence, the dot product of parallel vectors (or components) is the product of their lengths, and the dot product of perpendicular vectors is zero. Thus, we can also write that a dot product is equal to the sum-product of the like components:</p>
<p><men>\vec{A} \cdot \vec{B} =A_x B_x + A_y B_y = (A )( B)\cos \theta</men></p>

<title>Vector Magnitude vs. Scalar Value</title>


<p>Let us spend a few minutes talking about a couple more definitions and notation which are important when dealing with dot products. In <xref ref="dot_scalar"/> below we will contrast the magnitude of a vector with the scalar result of a dot product. </p>
<p>The magnitude of a vector and the scalar result of a dot product may seem like similar terms as they are both are numeric values which come from a vector or vectors. The key difference is that vector magnitudes are always positive or zero, yet scalar results of dot products can also be negative.</p><list xml:id="dot_scalar">

<title>Vector Projection</title>


<p>Now, let's look geometrically at the vector projections, by which we mean the rectangular component of one vector in the direction specified by another vector.   In the interactive of <xref ref="ggb_dot_product"/>, the projection of the blue vector <m>\vec{B}</m> in the direction of the red vector <m>\vec{A}</m> is the black vector <m>\vec{u}</m>.   If the vectors represent forces, the projection is also a force.</p>
<p>Interactive showing how a drawing a line perpendicular to <m>\vec{B}</m> to the tip of <m>\vec{A}</m> creates a right triangle with the interior angle <m>\theta</m>. You can change both vectors by dragging the orange <sq>+</sq> marks.</p>
<p>Our goal is to find the amount of tension force <m>\vec{A}</m> which is parallel to tension force <m>\vec{B}</m>. We see that the adjacent side of our new right triangle can be shown to be equal to <m>A \cos \theta</m>.  This appears to be the answer to our question, but how is it this value related to the dot product? It turns out that the dot product gives us a bit more than just <m>A \cos \theta</m>. Rearranging the right side of the basic dot product equation we can see that </p>
<p><men xml:id="projection">\vec{A}\cdot \vec{B}=( B )( A )\cos \theta =B \left \| \proj_{\vec{B}}\vec{A}\right \|</men></p>
<p/>
<p>So, the dot product of <m>\vec{A}</m> and <m>\vec{B}</m> gives us the projection of <m>\vec{A}</m> onto <m>\vec{B}</m> times the magnitude of <m>\vec{B}</m>. So, to find the scalar value of the projection of <m>\vec{A}</m> onto <m>\vec{B}</m> we write</p>
<p><men>\left \|\proj_{\vec{B}}\vec{A}\right \|=\underset{\text{calculus version}}{\left \| \frac{\left (\vec{A}\cdot \vec{B} \right )\vec{B}}{B^2}\right\|}=\frac{\vec{A}\cdot \vec{B}}{B}=\underset{\text{quick version}}{\vec{A}\cdot \vec{\hat{B}}}\\</men></p>
<p/>
<p>While you might have learned the <sq>calculus version</sq> if you have taken Calculus III there are simpler equivalent versions available. Rearranging <xref ref="projection"/> above, the projection of <m>\vec{A}</m> onto <m>\vec{B}</m> divided by the length of <m>\vec{B}</m>. This equation can be further simplified to the dot product of <m>\vec{A}</m> and the unit vector <m>\hat{B}</m>. As the unit vector <m>\hat{B}</m> has already been divided by the length of vector, <m>\left \| \vec{B} \right \|</m>.</p>
<p>Dot products always result in a scalar value: positive, negative, or zero. The spatial interpretation of the results of a dot product of <m>\vec{A}</m> and <m>\vec{B}</m> is:</p><list xml:id="dot_scalar_interpretation">

<p>One final modification you may need to perform is to find the vector projection of <m>\vec{A}</m> onto <m>\vec{B}</m>, as opposed to the scalar value which we solve for in equation <xref ref="projection"/> above.

In reference to our earlier cable example, the vector projection of <m>\vec{A}</m> onto <m>\vec{B}</m> would be the tension components of cable <m>\vec{A}</m> which are parallel to cable <m>\vec{B}</m>.</p>

<title>Three-Dimensional Vectors</title>

<introduction>
<p>While we often idealize our three-dimensional world into two-dimensions, there are many times we need to include the full three-dimensional geometry of a system in our computations. Hence, this section is devoted to three-dimensional vector computations. The topics covered in detail in the two-dimensional sections are extended in this section, while several new topics apply to three-dimensional vectors specifically.</p>
<p>For nearly all three-dimensional computations, you need the <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m> components of each vector before proceeding with the computations. If you are given the components upfront, then you are set to move forward, but sometimes vectors are defined by either <term>direction cosine angles</term> or <term>spherical angles</term>. The next sections detail how you can move back and forth between these angular systems and <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m> components.</p></introduction><subsection xml:id="coordinates-3d">

<title>Cartesian Coordinates </title>


<p>Extending two-dimensional Cartesian coordinates, you can express any point or vector in three-dimensional space with components in the <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m> orthogonal directions. The notation remains the same as for two-dimensional vectors, with the addition of a <m>z</m>-component vector and the corresponding unit vector <m>\khat</m>.</p></subsubsection><subsubsection xml:id="coordinates-3d-direction-cosine-angles">

<title>Direction Cosine Angles</title>


<p>The direction of a vector in two-dimensional systems could be expressed clearly with a single angle measured from a reference axis, but the added spatial complexity of a three-dimensional system means that a single angle is not enough to specify the direction of a vector. </p>
<p>One common way to define the direction of a three-dimensional vector is by using <term>direction cosine angles</term>, also commonly known as <term>coordinate direction angles</term>. The direction cosine angles are the three angle between the positive <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m> axes to a given vector and are called <m>\theta_x</m>, <m>\theta_y</m>, and <m>\theta_z</m>, respectively.   Three dimensional vectors, components, and angle are difficult to visualize.  The interactive shown in figure should help you develop your visualization skills, which will be helpful to have when solving problems.</p><figure xml:id="direction_angles">

<p>This interactive show how the direction cosine angles are the angles from the positive <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m> axes to the vector that they define. Note that direction cosine angles do not commonly lie in the Cartesian planes. If the vector has non-zero components in the <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m> directions, then all three direction cosine angles <m>\theta_x</m>, <m>\theta_y</m>, and  <m>\theta_z</m>  will be angles in the plane formed by each axis and the vector.</p></instructions></interactive></figure>
<p> Given the definition of direction cosine angles  we can also conclude that:
   <ol>
<li>
<p>Direction cosine angles must always be between <m>0\degree</m> and <m>180\degree</m> or <me>0\degree \le \theta_n \le 180\degree.</me></p></li>
<li>
<p>Any direction cosine angle greater than <m>90\degree</m> indicates a negative component along that respective axis. Spatially this is because all direction cosine angles are measured from the positive side of each axis. Mathematically this is because the cosine of any angle less than <m>90\degree</m> is numerically negative.</p></li></ol></p>
<p>We can also directly relate the components of a vector to its direction cosine angles using the following equations.</p>
<p><mdn><mrow>
\cos {\theta_x} = \frac{A_x}{\left |A  \right |}
     </mrow><mrow>
     \cos \theta_y = \frac {A_y}{\left |A  \right |}
     </mrow><mrow>
      \cos \theta_z = \frac {A_z}{\left |A  \right |}
     </mrow></mdn></p>
<p>Note the component in the numerator of each direction cosine equations is positive or negative as defined by the coordinate system, and the full-vector magnitude in the denominator is always positive. Looking closely at the right side of these three equations, notice that each equation consists of the component divided by the total vector magnitude, which you may recall are the same equations used for unit vectors. Thus, the cosine of each direction cosine angle collectively also computes the components of the unit vector; hence we can write an equation for <m>\hat{\vec{A}}</m>, <ie/>, the unit vector along <m>\vec{A}</m>. <me>\hat{\vec{A}}=\cos \theta_x  \ihat +\cos \theta_y  \jhat + \cos \theta_z \khat </me></p>
<p> Combining the Pythagorean Theorem with our knowledge of unit vectors, and direction cosine angles gives this result: if you know two of the three direction cosine angles you can manipulate the following equation to find the third.
   <men>\cos^2 \theta_x + \cos^2 \theta_y +\cos^2 \theta_z = 1</men></p></subsubsection><subsubsection xml:id="coordinates-3d-spherical-coordinates">

<title>Dot Products and Projections</title>


<p>This section builds on the basics of dot products started in <xref ref="dot_products_2D"/> earlier in this chapter. Recall that dot products find the amount of one vector parallel to another and are also useful to find the angle between two vectors. </p>
<p>Previously, we found that the dot product of the parallel unit vectors <m>\ihat</m> and <m>\jhat</m> was 1, while the dot product of the perpendicular unit vectors <m>\ihat</m> and Â£ was 0. We can expand this general relationship where the dot products of any two parallel unit vectors equal one and the dot product of any two perpendicular unit vectors is zero to demonstrate that</p>
<p><md><mrow>\ihat \cdot \ihat \amp = 1 \amp \jhat \cdot \ihat \amp = 0 \amp \khat \cdot \ihat \amp = 0</mrow><mrow>\ihat \cdot \jhat \amp = 0 \amp \jhat \cdot \jhat \amp = 1 \amp \khat \cdot \jhat \amp = 0</mrow><mrow>\ihat \cdot \khat \amp = 0 \amp \jhat \cdot \khat \amp = 0 \amp \khat \cdot \khat \amp = 1</mrow></md></p>
<p>For three-dimensional vectors we can also write that a dot product is equal to the sum-product of the like components:</p>
<p><me>\vec{A}\cdot \vec{B} =A_x B_x +A_y B_y + A_z B_z=\left ( A \right )\left ( B \right )\cos \theta</me></p>
<p>Just like we did for two-dimensional dot products, our goal is to find the amount of tension force <m>\vec{F}_A</m> which is parallel to tension force <m>\vec{F}_B</m>. In two-dimensional problems it can be straightforward to create a right triangle to resolve the projected length of <m>\vec{F}_A</m> onto <m>\vec{F}_B</m>, on three-dimensional problems youâll need to rely on the dot product from Equation XX above. As shown in the equation below, the easiest way to find the magnitude of the projection of <m>\vec{F}_A</m> onto <m>\vec{F}_B</m> is by dotting <m>\vec{F}_A</m> with <m>\hat{F_B}</m>.</p>
<p><men>\left \| \proj_{\vec{F}_B}\vec{F}_A\right \|=\underset{\text{Calculus version}}{\left \| \frac{\left (\vec{F}_A\cdot \vec{F}_B \right )\vec{F}_B}{B^2}\right\|}=\frac{\vec{F}_A\cdot \vec{F}_B}{B}=\underset{\text{quick version}}{\vec{F}_A\cdot \hat{\vec{F}}_B}</men></p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, dot products always result in a scalar value.  Refer to <xref ref="dot_scalar"/> help you to interpret the results of a dot product of <m>\vec{F}_A</m> and <m>\vec{F}_B</m>.</p>
<p>One final modification you may need to perform is to find the vector projection of <m>\vec{F}_A</m> onto <m>\vec{F}_B</m> (as opposed to the scalar value which we solve for in equation XX above). To project the scalar value onto <m>\vec{F}_B</m>, just multiply the scalar projection you solve for above by the unit vector <m>\hat{B}</m>. In reference to our earlier cable example, vector projection of <m>\vec{F}_A</m> onto <m>\vec{F}_B</m> would be the tension components of cable <m>\vec{F}_A</m>, which are parallel to cable <m>\vec{F}_B</m>.</p>
<p><men>\proj_{\vec{F}_B}\vec{F}_A=\underset{\text{calculus version}}{\frac{\left (\vec{F}_A\cdot \vec{F}_B \right )\vec{F}_B}{B^2}}=\underset{\text{quick version}}{\left (\vec{F}_A\cdot \hat{\vec{F}}_B \right )\hat{\vec{F}}_B}</men></p>
<p>Similar to equation XX above, both the calculus version and quick version are shown.  </p>
<p>The final topic which can be a useful application of dot products is to find the vector portion of <m>\vec{F}_A</m> which is perpendicular to <m>\vec{F}_B</m>. Since we already have the vector portion of <m>\vec{F}_A</m> which is parallel to <m>\vec{F}_B</m> (which is the <m>\proj_{\vec{F}_B}\vec{F}_A</m>), we can use vector algebra to show the following:</p>
<p><me>\vec{F}_A=\underset{\proj_{\vec{F}_B}\vec{F}_A}{\overrightarrow{\vec{F}_A \parallel \vec{F}_B}}+ \overrightarrow{\vec{F}_A \perp \vec{F}_B}</me></p>
<p>If we rearrange this equation to solve for <m>\vec{F_A \perp F_B}</m>, we find that </p>
<p><me>\vec{F_A \perp F_B}=\vec{F}_A - \vec{F_A \parallel F_B}</me></p>
<p>Thus, we can use all of our efforts to compute the portion of  <m>\vec{F}_A</m> to <m>\vec{F}_B</m> to quickly compute the vector portion of <m>\vec{F}_A</m> which is perpendicular to <m>\vec{F}_B</m>.</p><!-- I need to get this applet from Dan. --><figure xml:id="vector_dot_product_3d">
