    <p><term>Vectors</term> are physical quantities described by a magnitude and a direction.   Vectors are usually given a symbolic name which, in this book, will be typeset in bold like <m>\vec{r}</m> or <m>\vec{F}</m> to indicate the vector nature of the quantity.  Computations involving vectors must always consider the directionality of each term and follow the rules of vector algebra, which will be described in this chapter.  The primary vector quantity you will encounter in statics will be force, but moment and position vectors are also important.</p>
    <p>We can visualize a vector as an <term>arrow</term> pointing in a particular direction. The <term>tip</term> is the pointed end and the <term>tail</term> the trailing end. </p>
    <p>As vectors include direction, they operate along a <term>line of action</term>. A line of action can be thought of as an invisible string along which a vector can slide. Sliding a vector along its line of action does not change the vector, however, because sliding does not change either the magnitude or the direction.  This can be a handy tool to simplify vector problems.</p>
    <p>Force vectors have a <term>point of application</term>, which is the point at which the force is applied. Other vectors, such as moment vectors, are <term>free vectors</term>, which means that the point of application is not significant, and they can be moved freely to any location as long as the magnitude and direction is maintained.</p>
    <p>The vector’s <term>magnitude</term> is a <em>positive</em> real number including units that describes the <sq>strength</sq> or <sq>intensity</sq> of the vector. Graphically we represent a vector's magnitude by the length of its vector arrow, and symbolically by enclosing the vector by vertical bars.  This is the same notation as for the absolute value of a number.  The absolute value of a number and the magnitude of a vector can both be thought of as a distance from the origin, so the notation is appropriate. By convention the magnitude of a vector is also indicated, by the same letter as the vector, but in an non-bold font.  <me> F = |\vec{F}| = \text{magnitude of vector }\vec{F}</me></p>
    <p><term>Scalars</term> are physical quantities which have no associated direction and can be described by a positive or negative number, or even zero.  Scalar quantities follow the usual laws of algebra, and most scalar quantities have units. Mass, time, temperature, and length are all scalars. </p>
    <p>By itself, a vector’s magnitude is a scalar quantity, but it makes no sense to speak of a vector with a negative magnitude, so vector magnitudes are always positive or zero. Multiplying a vector by -1, produces a vector with the same magnitude but pointing in the opposite direction.</p>
    <p>Vector directions are described with respect to a <term>coordinate system</term>. A coordinate system is an arbitrary reference system used to establish the <term>origin</term>, and the primary directions.   Distances are usually measured from the origin, and directions from a primary or <term>reference direction</term>.  You are probably familiar with the Cartesian  coordinate system with mutually perpendicular x, y and z axes and the origin at their intersection point.</p>
    <p>Another way of describing a vector's direction is to specify its <term>orientation</term> and <term>sense</term>.  Orientation is the angle the vector's line of action makes with a specified reference direction, and sense defines the direction the vector points along its line of action.   A weight vector has a vertical orientation 90° from the horizontal axis, with a downward sense. </p>
    <p>A third way to represent the direction of a vector is with its <term>unit vector</term>. A unit vector is a vector with a length of one which has the same orientation and sense as a given vector. Hence, a unit vector is a pure direction, as it is independent of the magnitude and unit of measurement of the given vector. Unit vectors are discussed in more detail later in <xref ref="unit-vectors" text="title"/>. </p>
    <p>Later we will introduce <term>scalar components</term> as a means of describing vectors.  These are scalar quantities which may be positive or negative which may lead to some confusion.</p>
    <p>Vectors can either be either constant or vary as a function of time, position, or something else. For example, if a force varied with time according to the function <m>F(t) = 10t</m> [N] where <m>t</m> is the time in seconds, then the force would be <m>\N{0}</m> at <m>t=0</m>, and increase by <m>\N{10}</m> each second thereafter. </p>

          <p>         You can use this interactive diagram to adjust the magnitude and direction of the vector using point at the tip,  the point of application of the vector by sliding the tail along the line of action, and the direction of the vector by moving the direction of the line of action.</p>

    <introduction>
      <p>The simplest vector calculations involve one-dimensional vectors.  You can learn some important terminology here without much mathematical difficulty.</p>
      <p>In one-dimensional problems, all vectors share the same line of action, and either point the same way, or 180° opposite to each other along that line.</p>

      <title>Vector Addition </title>
      <p>Adding multiple vectors together finds the <term>resultant</term> vector, resultant vectors can be thought of as the <sq>sum of</sq> or <sq>combination</sq> of other vectors. To find the resultant vector <m>\vec{R}</m> of two one-dimensional vectors <m>\vec{A}</m>   and  <m> \vec{B}</m> you can simply use the tip-to-tail technique shown in <xref ref="vector_addition_1d"/> below. In the tip-to-tail technique, you slide vector <m>\vec{B}</m> until its tail is at the tip of <m>\vec{A}</m>, and the vector from the tail of <m>\vec{A}</m> to the tip of <m>\vec{B}</m> is the resultant <m>\vec{R}</m>. Note that the resultant <m>\vec{R}</m> is the same when you add <m>\vec{A}</m> onto <m>\vec{B}</m>, so the order of vector addition does not matter and is considered commutative.</p>

      <title>Vector Subtraction</title>
      <p>The easiest way to handle vector subtraction is to add the negative of the vector you are subtracting to the other vector. In this way, you can still use the tip-to-tail technique after flipping the vector you are subtracting. You can also simulate this in <xref ref="vector_addition_1d"/> by following the steps below.
<ol><li>Find <m>\vec{A}-\vec{B}</m> where <m>\vec{A}=\cm{2}</m> and <m>\vec{B}=\cm{3}</m>.</li><li>Set <m>\vec{A}</m> to a value of <m>\cm{2}</m> and <m>\vec{B}</m> to a value of <m>\cm{-3}</m> (the negative of its actual value).</li><li>Slide the tail of either vector to find the resultant (or sum) of these two vectors. The order does not matter because vector addition is commutative.</li><li>The result should be  <m>\cm{-1}</m>.</li></ol></p>

    <subsection xml:id="Chapter_02-one-dimensional-vectors-vector-multiplication-by-a-scalar">
      <title>Vector Multiplication by a Scalar</title>
      <p>Multiplying or dividing a vector by a scalar simply changes the magnitude of the vector but maintains the original line of action. One common transformations is to find the negative of a vector. To find the negative of vector <m>\vec{A}</m>, we multiply <m>\vec{A}</m> by -1, in equation form this looks like:</p>
      <p>
        <me>-\vec{A} =(-1) \vec{A} </me>
      </p>
      <p>Spatially, when you create a negative vector, you are simply flipping the tip and tail ends. The magnitude, line of action, and orientation stay the same, but the sense reverses so now the arrowhead points in the opposite direction. This can be simulated in <xref ref="vector_addition_1d"/> by changing one of the vectors from a positive to a negative value.</p>

    <title>Two Dimensional Coordinate Systems</title>
    <objectives>
      <ul>
        <li>Why are orthogonal coordinate systems useful?</li>
        <li>How do you transform between polar and Cartesian coordinates?</li>
      </ul>
    </objectives>
    <introduction>
      <p>A coordinate system gives us a frame of reference to describe a system which we would like to analyze.  In statics we normally use <term>orthogonal</term> coordinate systems, where orthogonal means <q>perpendicular</q>. In an orthogonal coordinate system the coordinate direction are perpendicular to each other and thereby independent. The intersection of the coordinate axes is called the <term>origin</term>, and measurements are made from there. Both points and vectors are described with a set of numbers called the <term>coordinates</term>.  For points in space, the coordinates specify the distance you must travel in each of the coordinate directions to get from the origin to the point in question. Together, the coordinates can be thought of as specifying a <term>position vector</term><em>,</em> a vector from the origin directly to the point.  The position vector gives the magnitude and direction needed to travel directly from the origin to the point.</p>
      <p>In the case of force vectors, the coordinates are the <term>scalar components</term> of the force in each of the coordinate directions.  These components locate the tip of the vector and they can be interpreted as the fraction of the total force which acts in each of the coordinate directions.</p>
      <p>Three coordinate directions are needed to map our real three-dimensional world, but in this section we will start with two, simpler, two-dimensional orthogonal systems: <term>rectangular</term> and <term>polar</term> coordinates<term>,</term> and the tools to convert from one to the other.</p>
    </introduction>
    <subsection xml:id="rectangular-coords">
      <title>Rectangular Coordinates</title>
      <p>The most important coordinate system is the <term>Cartesian</term> system, which was named after the French mathematician René Descartes. In two dimensions, the coordinate axes are straight lines named <m>x</m>, and <m>y</m>. </p>
      <sidebyside widths="50% 45%">
        <stack>
          <p>In most cases the <m>x</m> axis is horizontal and points to the right, and the <m>y</m> axis points vertically upward, however you are free to rotate or translate this entire coordinate system if you like.  It is usually mathematically advantageous to establish the origin at a convenient point to make measurements from, and to align one of the coordinate axes with a major feature of the problem.</p>
          <p>Points are specified as an ordered pair of coordinate values separated by a <em>comma</em> and enclosed in parentheses, <m>P = (x,y)</m>.</p>

          <p>  Given:  <m>x = -8.66</m>, <m>y = 5</m></p>

              <mrow>\amp \amp \amp = -\ang{30}</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>
          <p>You must be careful here and use some common sense.  The <m>\ang{-30}</m> angle your calculator gives you in this problem is incorrect because point <m>P</m> is in the second quadrant, but your calculator doesn't know this.    It can't tell whether the argument of  <m> \tan^{-1}(-0.577)</m> is negative because the  <m>x</m> was negative or because the <m>y</m> was negative, so it must make an assumption and in this case it is wrong.  </p>
          <p>The arctan function on calculators will always return values in the first and fourth quadrant.  If, by inspection of the <m>x</m> and the <m>y</m> coordinates, you see that the point is in the second or third quadrant, you must add or subtract <m>\deg{180}</m> to the calculator’s answer.</p>
          <p>So in this problem, <m>\theta</m> is really <m>\ang{-30} + \ang{180}</m>.  After making this adjustment, the the location of <m>P</m> in polar coordinates is:</p>

          <p>Most scientific calculators include handy polar-to-rectangular and rectangular-to-polar functions which can save you time and help you avoid errors.

      <title>Rectangular Coordinates</title>
      <p>We can extend the two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system into three dimensions easily by adding a <m>z</m> axis perpendicular to the two-dimensional cartesian plane.  The notation is similar the notation used for two-dimensional vectors. Points and forces are expressed as ordered triples of rectangular coordinates following the same notation used previously.</p>

        <p>Does it matter which way the axes are oriented?  Is it ok to make the <m>x</m> axis point left or the <m>y</m> axis point down?  </p>
        <p>In one sense, it doesn't matter at all.  The positive directions of the coordinate axes are arbitrary.  On the other hand, it's convenient for every one if we can agree on a standard orientation.  In mathematics and engineering the default is to orient the coordinate axes with the  <term>right hand rule</term>.  Coordinate systems which follow this rule are <term>right-handed</term>.</p>
        <p/>
        <sidebyside valign="top" widths="55% 40%">
          <p>To apply the right hand rule, orient your thumb and first two fingers at right angles to each other and align them with the three coordinate axes. Starting with your thumb, name your fingers in alphabetical order <m>x</m>-<m>y</m>-<m>z</m> as in diagram ❶.</p>

      <title>Direction Cosine Angles</title>
      <p>The direction of a vector in two-dimensional systems could be expressed clearly with a single angle measured from a reference axis, but adding an additional dimension means that one angle is not enough to specify the direction of a vector. </p>
      <p>One way to define the direction of a three-dimensional vector is by using <term>direction cosine angles</term>, also commonly known as <term>coordinate direction angles</term>. The direction cosine angles are the angles between the positive <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m> axes to a given vector and are traditionally named <m>\theta_x</m>, <m>\theta_y</m>, and <m>\theta_z</m>.   Three dimensional vectors, components, and angle are often difficult to visualize because they do not commonly lie in the Cartesian planes. </p>

      <p>We can relate the components of a vector to its direction cosine angles using the following equations. <mdn><mrow xml:id="direction-cosines">\cos {\theta_x} \amp = \frac{A_x}{\left |A  \right |} \amp \cos \theta_y \amp = \frac {A_y}{\left |A  \right |} \amp \cos \theta_z \amp = \frac {A_z}{\left |A  \right |}</mrow></mdn></p>
      <p>Note the component in the numerator of each direction cosine equation is positive or negative as defined by the coordinate system, and the vector magnitude in the denominator is always positive.  From these equations, we can conclude that:
<ul label="square"><li>Direction cosines are signed value between -1 and 1.</li><li>Direction cosine angles must always be between <m>\ang{0}</m> and <m>\ang{180}</m> or <me>\ang{0} \le \theta_n \le \ang{180}.</me></li><li>Any direction cosine angle greater than <m>\ang{90}</m> indicates a negative component along that respective axis. Spatially this is because all direction cosine angles are measured from the positive side of each axis. Mathematically this is because the cosine of any angle less than <m>\ang{90}</m> is numerically negative.</li></ul></p>

    <title>Unit Vectors</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>A unit vector is a vector with a magnitude of one, and no units.  As such, a unit vector represents a pure direction.  By convention a unit vector is indicated by a <em>hat</em> over a vector symbol. </p>
      <p>If a unit vector is multiplied by a scalar value, the vector is <em>scaled</em> by that amount, so for instance if a unit vector pointing to the right is multiplied by  <m>\N{ 100}</m> the result is a <m>\N{100}</m> vector pointing to the right, if a unit vector point up is multiplied by  <m>\N{ -50}</m> the result is a <m>\N{50}</m> vector pointing down.</p>
    </introduction>
    <subsection xml:id="unit-vectors">
      <title>Cartesian Unit Vectors</title>
      <p>Because they occur frequently, the unit vectors in each of the three Cartesian coordinate directions are given their own symbol, which are: 
<ul label="square"><li>The unit vector pointing in the <m>x</m> direction is <m>\ihat</m>,</li><li>The unit vector pointing in the <m>y</m> direction is <m>\jhat</m>, and</li><li>The unit vector pointing in the <m>z</m> direction is <m>\khat</m>.</li></ul></p>
      <p>Unit vectors may sound like a new concept, but you have been using unit vector components since you learned your trigonometric identities of sine and cosine.  </p>
      <p>Lets use the equation  <xref ref="p2r-vec"/> above: </p>
      <sidebyside widths="50%  30%" margins="0% 20%">
        <p><me>\vec{F}=F \left \langle \cos \theta, \sin \theta \right \rangle </me>.</p>

          </remix>
        </image>
      </sidebyside>
      <p>Now focus on the vector components inside the angled brackets in the equation above. Draw a right triangle with the perpendicular sides horizontal and vertical and a hypotenuse of one. Insert the angle <m>\theta</m> between the horizontal side and the hypotenuse. What equations do you find for the horizontal and vertical sides? You should discover that <m>\cos \theta</m> and <m>\sin \theta</m> are the horizontal and vertical components of the unit vector along <m>\vec{F}</m>. </p>
      <p>To further prove this fact, let us look at unit vectors in the context of the Pythagorean Theorem. The Pythagorean Theorem tells us that the sum of the squares of the length of both orthogonal legs of a right triangle must equal the square of the length of the hypotenuse. So, if <m>\cos  \theta</m> and <m>\sin  \theta</m> are the orthogonal components of the unit vector <m>\hat{\vec{F}}</m> and the length of the unit vector is one, then putting these values into the Pythagorean Theorem gives us:</p>
      <p>
        <me>\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1</me>
      </p>
      <p>Reflect for a few seconds if the equation above looks familiar. This is the equation for a circle centered at the origin with a radius of one unit. Hence, no matter what the angle <m>\theta</m> from a horizontal axis to a line is, the terms <m>\cos \theta</m> and <m>\sin \theta</m> make up the components of the unit vector along the line. Note that if the angle <m>\theta</m> is measured from a vertical axis, then the sine and cosine flip, with <m>\sin \theta</m> defining the horizontal component and the <m>\cos\ \theta</m> defining the vertical component of the unit vector. </p>

      <p>Given the properties of unit vectors, there are a couple of conceptual checks you can make after computing unit vector components which can save you subsequent errors.
<ol><li>All the signs of unit vector components need to match the signs of the original position vector. A unit vector has the same line of action and sense as the position vector but is scaled down to just one unit in magnitude.</li><li>Components of a unit vector must be between -1 and 1. If the magnitude of a unit vector is one, then it is impossible for it to have rectangular components larger than one.</li></ol></p>

      <title>Unit Vectors and Direction Cosines</title>
      <p>Looking closely at the right side of equation <xref ref="direction-cosines"/>, notice that each equation consists of a component divided by the total vector magnitude, which you may recall are the same equations used for unit vectors. Thus, the cosine of each direction cosine angle collectively also computes the components of the unit vector; hence we can write an equation for <m>\hat{\vec{A}}</m>, <ie/>, the unit vector along <m>\vec{A}</m>. <me>\hat{\vec{A}}=\cos \theta_x  \ihat +\cos \theta_y  \jhat + \cos \theta_z \khat </me></p>
      <p>Combining the Pythagorean Theorem with our knowledge of unit vectors, and direction cosine angles gives this result: if you know two of the three direction cosine angles you can manipulate the following equation to find the third. <men>\cos^2 \theta_x + \cos^2 \theta_y +\cos^2 \theta_z = 1</men></p>

      <p>There are two ways to graphically add vectors: the Triangle Rule and Parallelogram Rule. Note that in this section we focus on problems where just two vectors are summed to find their resultant. When you need to find the resultant of more than two vectors, it is typically best to use the Algebraic Addition of Components below.
<ul label="square"><li>For the Triangle Rule, place the tail of one vector at the tip of the other vector, then draw the resultant from the first vector's tail to the final vector's tip. </li><li>Next for the Parallelogram Rule, you line up the tails of both vectors, then complete a parallelogram with extension lines parallel to each vector. The resultant is equal to the diagonal from the tails to the opposite corner.</li></ul></p>
      <p>	Refer to the interactive in <xref ref="addition-2d-views"/>. This interactive allows you to adjust the directions of both the <m>\lb{5} </m> and  <m>\lb{10}</m> tension forces acting on the eye bolt and see how the triangle rule and parallelogram rule both give you the same resultant force <m>\vec{R}</m>. </p>
      <p>	Once you draw your triangle or parallelogram, then you can use various tools from trigonometry to solve for the unknown sides or angles. The triangle definitions can be viewed in <xref ref="triangle_definitions"/> and the trigonometric tools for triangles you need are found in <xref ref="trig_tools"/> below.</p>

      <p>Using triangle-based geometry to solve vector problems can be a quick and powerful tool, but includes the following limitations:
<ul label="square"><li>There are only three sides in a triangle; thus graphical addition is limited to two vectors (and the resultant). You could still draw graphical shapes with three or more vectors to be added but then the shapes become complex polygons.</li><li>If you fail to draw the correct vector triangle, you will not find the correct answer. </li><li>The trigonometric functions in Table dd above, are all scalar functions. Thus, they are quick ways of solving for the magnitudes of vectors and the angle between vectors, but you would need to complete more analysis if you were asked to find the vector components of an angle from a given datum.</li></ul></p>
      <p>	If any of these limitations apply to the problem you are trying to solve, never fear, just move onto the next section where you will learn to perform the Algebraic Addition of Components.</p>

    <subsection xml:id="vector_algebra_2D-rectangular-components">
      <title>Rectangular Components</title>
      <p>One of the most useful tools for solving problems with vector algebra is to express vectors in terms of rectangular components.  We can describe any two-dimensional vector as the vector sum of two rectangular components, or three for three-dimensional vectors.</p>
      <p>Recall that vector components of arbitrary vector <m>\vec{F}</m> are the sides of a parallelogram which has <m>\vec{F}</m> as its diagonal. Because there are an infinite number of such parallelograms, each vector has an infinite number of pairs of components.  When the parallelogram happens to be a rectangle,  the components are called <em>rectangular components</em>. One particular set of rectangular components is of special interest: when the sides of the rectangle are parallel to the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> axes.  These particular components are designated  <m>\vec{F}_x</m> and <m>\vec{F}_y</m> where the subscripts indicate that the components are aligned with the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> axes. </p>
      <p>We can express the Cartesian vector components of <m>\vec{F}</m> as:</p>
      <p>
        <men>\vec{F} = \vec{F}_x + \vec{F}_y = \vec{F}_{x'} + \vec{F}_{y'}</men>

      <p>You can express any vector as the sum of two orthogonal components using either a horizontal <m>x</m> axis and vertical <m>y</m> axis or rotate the coordinate system to any other angle you like.</p>
      <p>One benefit of finding orthogonal vector components is that each component is independent of the other. This independence simplifies the vector computations greatly by allowing us to use independent equations for each orthogonal direction.  Another benefit is  that once you  have separated a vector into vector components parallel to the coordinate axes, you can treat these components as scalar quantities and use ordinary algebra rather than vector algebra to solve many problems.</p>

    <subsection xml:id="vector_algebra_2D-algebraic-addition-of-components">
      <title>Algebraic Addition of Components</title>
      <p>While the parallelogram rule and the graphical and trigonometric methods covered in the previous section are useful tools to for visualizing and finding the sum of two vectors, they are not particularly suited for adding <em>more</em> than two vectors.  </p>
      <p>Consider vector <m>\vec{R}</m> which is the sum of several vectors <m>\vec{A}</m>, <m>\vec{B}</m>, <m>\vec{C}</m> and perhaps more.  We say that <m>\vec{A}</m>, <m>\vec{B}</m> and <m>\vec{C}</m> are the components of <m>\vec{R}</m>, and the <m>\vec{R}</m> is the resultant of <m>\vec{A}</m>, <m>\vec{B}</m> and <m>\vec{C}</m>.  It is easy enough to say that <m>\vec{R} = \vec{A}+ \vec{B}+ \vec{C}</m>, but how can we calculate <m>\vec{R}</m> if we know the components?  You could draw the vectors arranged tip-to-tail and then use the triangle rule to add the first two components, then use it again to add the third component to that sum, and so forth until all the components have been added. The final sum is the resultant, <m>\vec{R}</m>.  The process gets progressively more tedious the more components there are to sum.</p>
      <p>This section introduces an alternate method to add multiple vectors which is straightforward, efficient and robust.  This is called <em>algebraic method</em>, because the vector addition is replaced with a process of <em>scalar</em> addition of <em>scalar</em> components. The algebraic technique works equally well for two and three dimensional vectors, and for summing any number of vectors.</p>
      <p>To find the sum of multiple vectors using the algebraic:
<ol><li>Find the scalar components of each component vector in the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> directions using the P to R procedure described in <xref ref="coord-transformation"/>.</li><li>Algebraically sum the scalar components in each coordinate direction.  The scalar components will be positive if they point right or up, negative if they point left or down.  These sums are the scalar components of the resultant.</li><li>Resolve the resultant's components to find the magnitude and direction of the resultant vector using the R to P procedure described in <xref ref="coord-transformation"/>.</li></ol></p>
      <p>This process is illustrated in the following interactive diagram and in the next example.</p>

      <title>Vector Subtraction</title>
      <p>Like one-dimensional vector subtraction, the easiest way to handle two dimensional vector subtraction is a combination of taking the negative of a vector followed by vector addition. Multiplying any vector by -1 preserves its magnitude but flips its direction, having the net effect of changing the sign of each scalar component. After flipping the vector you are subtracting, then you can choose any of the above techniques for vector addition.</p>

        <p>Coming back to our basic dot product equation, we can compute the dot products of unit vectors <m>\ihat</m> and <m>\jhat</m>. The dot product of <m>\ihat</m> and <m>\ihat</m> is:</p>
        <p>
          <me>\ihat \cdot \ihat = (1) (1)\cos \ang{0} = 1 </me>
        </p>
        <p/>
        <p>As the length of <m>\ihat</m> is just 1, equation result is dependent on the <m>\cos \theta</m>. Of course, in this case <m>\theta = \ang{0}</m> and we know that the <m>\cos \ang{0} = 1 </m>.</p>
        <p>Similarly, the orthogonal unit vectors <m>\ihat</m> and <m>\jhat</m> are <m>\ang{90}</m> apart so,</p>
        <p>
          <me> \ihat \cdot \jhat = (1) (1)\cos \ang{90}  = 0</me>
        </p>
        <p/>
        <p>Hence, the dot product of parallel vectors is the product of their lengths, and the dot product of perpendicular vectors is zero. Thus, we can also write that a dot product is equal to the sum-product of the like components:</p>

      <title>Vector Projection</title>
      <p>Now, let's look geometrically at the vector projection of one vector onto the direction of another vector.   In the interactive of <xref ref="ggb_dot_product"/>, the projection of the blue vector <m>\vec{B}</m> in the direction of the red vector <m>\vec{A}</m> is the black vector <m>\vec{u}</m>.   If the vectors represent forces, the projection is also a force.  You can think of a projection of <m>\vec{B}</m> on <m>\vec{A}</m> as the shadow of <m>\vec{B}</m> on  the line of action of <m>\vec{A}</m> when the sun is directly above <m>\vec{A}</m>.</p>
      <p>Interactive showing how a drawing a line perpendicular to <m>\vec{B}</m> to the tip of <m>\vec{A}</m> creates a right triangle with the interior angle <m>\theta</m>. You can change both vectors by dragging the orange <sq>+</sq> marks.</p>
      <p>Our goal is to find the amount of tension force <m>\vec{A}</m> which is parallel to tension force <m>\vec{B}</m>. We see that the adjacent side of our new right triangle can be shown to be equal to <m>A \cos \theta</m>.  This appears to be the answer to our question, but how is it this value related to the dot product? It turns out that the dot product gives us a bit more than just <m>A \cos \theta</m>. Rearranging the right side of the basic dot product equation we can see that </p>
      <p>
        <men xml:id="projection">\vec{A}\cdot \vec{B}=( B )( A )\cos \theta =B \left \| \proj_{\vec{B}}\vec{A}\right \|</men>
      </p>
      <p/>
      <p>So, the dot product of <m>\vec{A}</m> and <m>\vec{B}</m> gives us the projection of <m>\vec{A}</m> onto <m>\vec{B}</m> times the magnitude of <m>\vec{B}</m>. So, to find the scalar value of the projection of <m>\vec{A}</m> onto <m>\vec{B}</m> we write</p>
      <p>
        <men xml:id="projection2">\left \|\proj_{\vec{B}}\vec{A}\right \|=\underset{\text{calculus version}}{\left \| \frac{\left (\vec{A}\cdot \vec{B} \right )\vec{B}}{B^2}\right\|}=\frac{\vec{A}\cdot \vec{B}}{B}=\underset{\text{quick version}}{\vec{A}\cdot \vec{\hat{B}}}\\</men>
      </p>
      <p/>
      <p>While you might have learned the <sq>calculus version</sq> if you have taken Calculus III there are simpler equivalent versions available. Rearranging <xref ref="projection"/> above, the projection of <m>\vec{A}</m> onto <m>\vec{B}</m> divided by the length of <m>\vec{B}</m>. This equation can be further simplified to the dot product of <m>\vec{A}</m> and the unit vector <m>\hat{B}</m>. As the unit vector <m>\hat{B}</m> has already been divided by the length of vector, <m>\left \| \vec{B} \right \|</m>.</p>
      <p>Dot products always result in a scalar value: positive, negative, or zero. The spatial interpretation of the results of a dot product of <m>\vec{A}</m> and <m>\vec{B}</m> is:</p>

      <title>Dot Products and Projections</title>
      <p>This section builds on the basics of dot products started in <xref ref="dot_products_2D"/> earlier in this chapter. Recall that dot products find the amount of one vector parallel to another and are also useful to find the angle between two vectors. </p>
      <p>Previously, we found that the dot product of the parallel unit vectors <m>\ihat</m> and <m>\jhat</m> was 1, while the dot product of the perpendicular unit vectors <m>\ihat</m> and £ was 0. We can expand this general relationship where the dot products of any two parallel unit vectors equal one and the dot product of any two perpendicular unit vectors is zero to demonstrate that</p>
      <p>

          <mrow>\ihat \cdot \ihat \amp = 1 \amp \jhat \cdot \ihat \amp = 0 \amp \khat \cdot \ihat \amp = 0</mrow>
          <mrow>\ihat \cdot \jhat \amp = 0 \amp \jhat \cdot \jhat \amp = 1 \amp \khat \cdot \jhat \amp = 0</mrow>
          <mrow>\ihat \cdot \khat \amp = 0 \amp \jhat \cdot \khat \amp = 0 \amp \khat \cdot \khat \amp = 1</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>For three-dimensional vectors we can also write that a dot product is equal to the sum-product of the like components:</p>
      <p>
        <me>\vec{A}\cdot \vec{B} =A_x B_x +A_y B_y + A_z B_z=\left ( A \right )\left ( B \right )\cos \theta</me>
      </p>
      <p>Just like we did for two-dimensional dot products, our goal is to find the amount of tension force <m>\vec{F}_A</m> which is parallel to tension force <m>\vec{F}_B</m>. In two-dimensional problems it can be straightforward to create a right triangle to resolve the projected length of <m>\vec{F}_A</m> onto <m>\vec{F}_B</m>, on three-dimensional problems you’ll need to rely on the dot product from Equation XX above. As shown in the equation below, the easiest way to find the magnitude of the projection of <m>\vec{F}_A</m> onto <m>\vec{F}_B</m> is by dotting <m>\vec{F}_A</m> with <m>\hat{F_B}</m>.</p>
      <p>
        <men>\left \| \proj_{\vec{F}_B}\vec{F}_A\right \|=\underset{\text{Calculus version}}{\left \| \frac{\left (\vec{F}_A\cdot \vec{F}_B \right )\vec{F}_B}{B^2}\right\|}=\frac{\vec{F}_A\cdot \vec{F}_B}{B}=\underset{\text{quick version}}{\vec{F}_A\cdot \hat{\vec{F}}_B}</men>
      </p>
      <p>As mentioned earlier, dot products always result in a scalar value.  Refer to <xref ref="dot_scalar"/> help you to interpret the results of a dot product of <m>\vec{F}_A</m> and <m>\vec{F}_B</m>.</p>
      <p>One final modification you may need to perform is to find the vector projection of <m>\vec{F}_A</m> onto <m>\vec{F}_B</m> (as opposed to the scalar value which we solve for in equation XX above). To project the scalar value onto <m>\vec{F}_B</m>, just multiply the scalar projection you solve for above by the unit vector <m>\hat{B}</m>. In reference to our earlier cable example, vector projection of <m>\vec{F}_A</m> onto <m>\vec{F}_B</m> would be the tension components of cable <m>\vec{F}_A</m>, which are parallel to cable <m>\vec{F}_B</m>.</p>
      <p>
        <men>\proj_{\vec{F}_B}\vec{F}_A=\underset{\text{calculus version}}{\frac{\left (\vec{F}_A\cdot \vec{F}_B \right )\vec{F}_B}{B^2}}=\underset{\text{quick version}}{\left (\vec{F}_A\cdot \hat{\vec{F}}_B \right )\hat{\vec{F}}_B}</men>
      </p>
      <p>Similar to equation XX above, both the calculus version and quick version are shown.  </p>
      <p>The final topic which can be a useful application of dot products is to find the vector portion of <m>\vec{F}_A</m> which is perpendicular to <m>\vec{F}_B</m>. Since we already have the vector portion of <m>\vec{F}_A</m> which is parallel to <m>\vec{F}_B</m> (which is the <m>\proj_{\vec{F}_B}\vec{F}_A</m>), we can use vector algebra to show the following:</p>
      <p>
        <me>\vec{F}_A=\underset{\proj_{\vec{F}_B}\vec{F}_A}{\overrightarrow{\vec{F}_A \parallel \vec{F}_B}}+ \overrightarrow{\vec{F}_A \perp \vec{F}_B}</me>
      </p>
      <p>If we rearrange this equation to solve for <m>\vec{F_A \perp F_B}</m>, we find that </p>
      <p>
        <me>\vec{F_A \perp F_B}=\vec{F}_A - \vec{F_A \parallel F_B}</me>
      </p>
      <p>Thus, we can use all of our efforts to compute the portion of  <m>\vec{F}_A</m> to <m>\vec{F}_B</m> to quickly compute the vector portion of <m>\vec{F}_A</m> which is perpendicular to <m>\vec{F}_B</m>.</p>

    <sidebyside widths="55% 42%">
      <p>The vector cross product is a mathematical operation applied to two vectors which produces a third vector as a result.   It's sometimes called the vector product, to emphasize this and to distinguish it from the dot product which produces a scalar value.  The <m>\times</m> symbol is used to indicate this operation.  The interactive shows the relation of the cross product to the two vectors and the angle between them.</p>

    <p>The cross product is defined by <men xml:id="cross-product-def"> \vec{C} = \vec{A} \times \vec{B} = A \; B \sin \theta \;\hat{\vec{u}}</men>, where <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are the magnitudes of <m>\vec{A}</m> and <m>\vec{B}</m>, <m>\theta</m> is the angle between them, and <m>\hat{\vec{u}}</m> is a unit vector perpendicular to the plane of <m>\vec{A}</m> and <m>\vec{B}</m> whose sense is determined with the right hand rule.</p>
    <p>The magnitude of vector <m>\vec{C}</m> is is the area of the parallelogram formed by vectors <m>\vec{A}</m> and <m>\vec{B}</m>.  The magnitude of the cross product is zero if <m>\vec{A}</m> and <m>\vec{B}</m> are parallel, and it is a maximum when they are perpendicular.</p>
    <p>You will notice that all the terms in the cross product equation are quite similar to those of the dot product, with the exception of the unit vector <m>\hat{\vec{u}}</m> and the use of <m>\sin</m> rather than <m>\cos</m>. This unit vector <m>\hat{\vec{u}}</m> is simple to find in a two-dimensional problem as it will always be perpendicular to the page, but for three-dimensional cross products it is advisable to use a vector determinate method discussed here.</p>

      <title>Cross Product of Unit Vectors</title>
      <p>Since unit vectors have a unit magnitude by definition, and orthogonal vectors are perpendicular to each other, the magnitude of the cross product of two different unit vectors will always be one. The direction is given by the cross product circle shown in <xref ref="cross_product_circle_EE"/>. For example when you cross <m>\ihat</m> with <m>\jhat</m>  you are going in the positive direction (counterclockwise which is also the + RHR direction) around the blue inner circle and thus the answer is <m>+\khat</m>. But when you cross <m>\jhat</m> into <m>\ihat</m> you go in the negative (clockwise) direction around the circle and thus get a  <m>-\khat</m>.  Remember that the order of cross products matter. If you put the vectors in the wrong order, you will introduce a negative value error.</p>

      <title>Cross Product of Arbitrary Vectors</title>
      <p>The cross product of two three-dimensional vectors can be calculated by evaluating the <em>determinant</em> of this <m>3\times 3</m> matrix. 
<men xml:id="cross-product-1"> 
\vec{A} \times \vec{B} = \begin{vmatrix}
\ihat \amp \jhat \amp \khat \\ 
A_x \amp A_y \amp A_z \\ 
B_x \amp B_y  \amp B_z \end{vmatrix} 
</men></p>
      <p>Here, the first row are the unit vectors, the second row are the components of <m>\vec{A}</m> and the third row are the components of <m>\vec{B}</m>.  </p>
      <p>Calculating the <m>3 \times 3</m> determinant can be reduced to calculating three <m>2 \times 2</m> determinants using the method of cofactors, as follows 
<men>\vec{A} \times \vec{B} = 
+\begin{vmatrix} A_y \amp A_z \\ B_y \amp B_z \end{vmatrix} \ihat
-\begin{vmatrix} A_x \amp A_z \\ B_x \amp B_z \end{vmatrix} \jhat
+\begin{vmatrix} A_x \amp A_y \\ B_x \amp B_y \end{vmatrix} \jhat
</men></p>
      <p>Finally a <m>2 \times 2</m> determinant can be evaluated with the formula
<men> \begin{vmatrix} a \amp b \\ c \amp d\end{vmatrix} = a d - b c</men></p>
      <p>In practice, the easiest way to evaluate a three dimensional cross product is to use the augmented determinant below, where the  first two columns have been copied and placed after the determinant.  The cross product is then calculated by adding the product of the red diagonals and subtracting the product of blue diagonals.</p>

    <!--TODO this chapter summary is incomplete -->
    <p>The <term>Dot Product</term> is a vector multiplication process defined by <me>\vec{A} \cdot \vec{B} =  A \; B  \cos \theta  = A_x B_x + A_y B_y  </me>  The result is a scalar value, and the operation is commutative, so <me>\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B}=\vec{B}\cdot\vec{A}</me></p>
    <p>The resulting value is the product <m>\proj_\vec{A}\vec{B}</m> with the magnitude of <m>\vec{B}</m>. The result is a signed value which can be positive or negative. A negative value indicates that the projection of <m>\vec{A}</m> onto <m>\vec{B}</m> and <m>\vec{B}</m> have opposite senses.  </p>
    <p>Dot products are used in mechanics to find vector projections and the component of one vector in a direction which is parallel to another.</p>
    <p>The <term>Cross Product</term> is a vector multiplication process defined by  <me>\vec{A} \times \vec{B}=  A \; B \sin \theta \; \hat{\vec{u}}</me>.  If <m>\vec{A}</m> and <m>\vec{B}</m> are in the <m>xy</m> plane, this evaluates to <me> \vec{A} \times \vec{B}=(A_y B_x - A_x B_y) \khat</me>. The result is a vector mutually perpendicular to the first two with a sense determined by the right hand rule. The magnitude is the product of the perpendicular component of <m>\vec{A}</m> with the magnitude of <m>\vec{B}</m>.  The operation is not commutative, in fact <me>\vec{A}\times \vec{B}= \mathbf{-} \vec{B} \times \vec{A} </me>. </p>
    <p>Cross products are used in mechanics to find the moment of a force about about a point.</p>
    <p>Both vector products are most useful when working in three dimensions, since simpler approaches are available for two-dimensional problems.</p>
