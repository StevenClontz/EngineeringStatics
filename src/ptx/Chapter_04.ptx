<title>Introduction</title>


<p>When a force is applied to a body, it can have the tendency to move the body in the direction of the force (translation) and rotate the body about an axis. We have already explored the translational tendency of forces in Chapters 2 and 3, and will focus on this rotational tendency of forces here in Chapter 4. This rotational tendency is known as the moment of the force, or more simply referred to simply as the <term>moment</term>. Moments and torques are the exact same thing. Physicists commonly use the term torque while engineers often use the term moment.</p>
<p>All moments are vectors and are computed around a specific point, therefore we use the notation<m>\vec{M_A}</m> for the moment vector around point A. One common situation where you may have encountered moments is when you tighten or loosen a bolt with a wrench. When a force <m>\vec{F}</m> is applied to the wrench, as shown in Figure AA below, one effect of the applied force is to rotate the wrench with moment <m>\vec{M_A}</m> about an axis passing through the centerline of the bolt at A. </p>

<p>When working with moments, it is important to remember that moments are vectors. That is, they have both a magnitude and a direction. As such, they obey all rules of vector addition and subtraction described in Chapter 2 Forces and Other Vectors. They also have a point of application, although it is more accurate to say that moments have an axis of rotation. In two dimensions, moments will rotate about the axis perpendicular to the two-dimensional plane (hence the axis will be perpendicular to the screen/page) and so will appear to act around a point. In three dimensions, the axis of rotation can be going in any direction.</p>
<p>Like forces, moments have a positive and negative direction. Since moments are rotational, they may also be referred to by their direction of rotation: clockwise or counterclockwise. Using the right-hand rule convention, counter-clockwise moments are positive and clockwise moments are negative. As shown in figure BB and CC below, there are multiple ways to use your right hand to determine the sign of a moment. They all produce the same answer, so you don’t need to learn all techniques, but make sure you find one of them which you can use accurately and consistently.</p>

You can use the three-finger right-hand rule technique to find the direction of the moment in two different ways. As shown on the left in ❶, you can align the position vector <m>\vec{r}</m> with your thumb, force vector <m>\vec{F}</m> with your index finger, and your middle finger will then be the positive axis around which <m>\vec{M}</m> is rotating. As shown on the right in ❷, you can align the position vector <m>\vec{r}</m> with your index finger, the force vector <m>\vec{F}</m> with your middle finger, and your thumb will then be the positive axis around which <m>\vec{M}</m> is rotating.

An alternate to the three-finger right-hand rule technique is the point-and-curl right-hand rule technique. Start with your hand flat and fingertips pointing along the position vector <m>\vec{r}</m> going FROM the point of interest TO the force line of action, then the force vector <m>\vec{F}</m> pushes fingers into a curl, and finally, your thumb axis around which the moment is rotating <m>\vec{M}</m>.

<title>Scalar Moments</title>

<objectives><introduction>
<p>Key Questions:</p></introduction><ul><li>Why is there no moment about any point on the line of action of a force?</li><li>If you increase the distance between your force and point of interest, does the moment of the force go up or down? </li><li>What practical applications can you think of that could use this relationship?</li></ul></objectives>
<p>As you likely already know or observed, the moment of a force depends on how far the force acts from the point about which you are taking the moment. In Figure DD below, the distance information is added to the wrench example outlined in Figure AA. The magnitude of the moment about A <m>\vec{M_A}</m> is calculated by multiplying the magnitude of force <m>\vec{F}</m> by the length of the perpendicular moment arm <m>d_{\perp}</m>. The scalar equation to calculate the moment <m>\vec{F}</m> creates about A is:</p>
<p><me>M_A ={F} d_{\perp}</me></p>
<p>Notice that the magnitude of a moment depends only on the magnitude of the force and the length of the moment arm. Every point on the wrench experiences a different moment due to the force, with the points on the force's line of action having no moment due to the zero-length moment arm from these points. The direction of the moment at each point is determined by the right-hand rule as outlined in the previous section. If the bolt at A is difficult to remove, we can apply a larger moment. This could be done by 1) optimizing the direction of the force relative to the wrench, 2) increasing the magnitude of the force, or 3) moving the force further from the axis of rotation.</p>

<p>This interactive adds moment arms to the wrench example outlined in <xref ref="rhr3"/>.</p></instructions></interactive></figure>
<p>Notice that the moment arm always points FROM the point you are taking the moment about TO the force’s line of action. Practice using the right-hand rule to determine the direction of the moment as you rotate the wrench and <m>\vec{F}</m>. We will introduce the use of the general position vector <m>\vec{r}</m> in the sections ahead.</p></section><section xml:id="Chapter_04-cross-products">

<title>Cross Products</title>

<objectives><introduction>
<p>Key Questions:</p></introduction><ul><li>How is a cross product different than a dot product?</li><li>Where does the moment arm vector <m>\vec{r}</m> start and end?</li><li>Why does Varignon’s Theorem give you the same answer as a determinate?</li></ul></objectives>
<p>You may have noticed in <xref ref="ggb_xnakpuqq"/> that there were two different position vectors shown from bolt <m>A</m> to the line of action of the force <m>\vec{F}</m>. The more general of the two is <m>\vec{r}</m> which, by definition, goes from the point of interest to any point on the line of action of the force. You can use any <m>\vec{r }</m> that originates at  A and ends at a point on the line of action of <m>\vec{F}</m>, but the one down the handle of the wrench is probably the easiest to construct. </p>
<p>Although we refer to the moment about a point (on the two-dimensional body), the moment is actually rotating about an axis. Using our standard <m>x</m>-<m>y</m> axes in the plane of the screen/paper, all two-dimensional moments rotate about a <m>z</m> axis which is perpendicular to the page/screen. </p>
<p>Finding a cross product is a vector operation where you feed the cross product two vectors and it gives you a vector answer that is perpendicular to both vectors you crossed. The most basic equation for computing a cross product is </p>
<p><men>\vec{A} \times \vec{B} = ( A )( B )\sin \theta \; \hat{\vec{u}}</men></p>
<p>where <m>\theta</m> is the angle between the two vectors as shown in <xref ref="ggb_xnakpuqq"/> above, and <m>\hat{\vec{u}}</m> is the unit vector perpendicular to both <m>\vec{A}</m> and <m>\vec{B}</m>  with the direction coming from the right-hand rule.</p>
<p>Before we get into the details of using matrices to cross full vectors, let us start with crossing unit vectors. One way to define the cross products of unit vectors is with the cross product circle shown in <xref ref="cross_product_circle_EE"/>. For example when you cross <m>\ihat</m> with <m>\jhat</m>  you are going in the positive direction (counterclockwise which is also the + RHR direction) around the blue inner circle and thus the answer is <m>+\khat</m>. But when you cross <m>\jhat</m> into <m>\ihat</m> you go in the negative (clockwise) direction around the circle and thus get a  <m>-\khat</m>. </p><figure xml:id="cross_product_circle_EE">

<p>All the possible combinations of positive value unit vector cross products create the following equations</p>
<p><md><mrow>\ihat \times \ihat \amp =0       \amp \ihat \times \jhat \amp = \khat \amp \ihat \times \khat \amp = -\jhat</mrow><mrow>\jhat \times \ihat \amp = -\khat \amp \jhat \times \jhat \amp = 0     \amp \jhat \times \khat \amp = \ihat </mrow><mrow>\khat \times \ihat \amp = \jhat  \amp \khat \times \jhat \amp =-\ihat \amp \khat \times \khat \amp =0 </mrow></md></p>
<p>If you have any negative unit vectors it is easiest to separate the negative values until after you have taken the cross product. Therefore <me>-\jhat \times \ihat = (-1)\left ( \jhat \times \ihat \right )=(-1)(-\khat )=+\khat </me></p>
<p>You will notice that all the terms in the cross product equation are quite similar to those of the dot product, with the exception of the unit vector <m>\hat{\vec{u}}</m>. This unit vector <m>\hat{\vec{u}}</m> is simple to find in a two-dimensional problem as it will always be perpendicular to the page/screen, but for three-dimensional cross products it is advisable to use a vector determinate which will be covered in the next section. Table aa below should help you contrast dot products and cross products.</p><table xml:id="contrast_dot_cross">

<p>Often the most robust approach to finding the moment of a force is using the cross product of <m>\vec{r}</m> and <m>\vec{F}</m> in the equation: <men>\vec{M} = \vec{r} \times \vec{F}</men></p>
<p>where <m>\vec{r}</m>  is a position vector from the point of interest to the line of action of the force, and <m>\vec{F}</m> is a force vector.</p>
<p>As introduced in the previous section, if you know the angle <m>\theta</m> between <m>\vec{r}</m> and <m>\vec{F}</m> you can use </p>
<p><md><mrow>\vec{r} \times \vec{F}\amp =\left |\vec{r} \right |  \left |\vec{F} \right |  \sin \theta \, \hat{\vec{u}}</mrow></md></p>
<p>However if you know the components of the position <m>\vec{r}</m> and force <m>\vec{F}</m> vectors, it is typically most efficient to express the cross product as a determinant which includes both <m>\vec{r}</m> and <m>\vec{F}</m> in the form:
<me>\vec{M}  = \vec{r} \times \vec{F} = \begin{bmatrix}
\ihat \amp \jhat \amp \khat\\ 
{r}_{x} \amp {r}_{y} \amp 0\\ 
{F}_{x} \amp {F}_{y} \amp 0
\end{bmatrix}</me></p>
<p>There are a number of ways to compute determinants, but all methods fundamentally sum the products of the matrix diagonals. Therefore, in a two-dimensional cross product, the only components to cause a cross product are the perpendicular ones <m>\vec{r_x}\times \vec{F_y}</m>  and <m>\vec{r_y}\times \vec{F_x}</m>, which are also perpendicular to each other in a determinant. Hopefully you have already recognized that the process of multiplying the diagonals in a determinant fundamentally is doing the right-hand rule for you. For this reason, diagonal products angled down and to the right are all positive and the diagonal products angled down and to the left are all negative (as shown in Equation XX below). You can validate the signs as the equation <m>\vec{r_x}\times \vec{F_y}</m> is essentially <m>\left ( \ihat \times \jhat \right ){r_x}{F_y}</m>  and  <m>\left ( \ihat \times \jhat \right)  = +\khat</m>. Conversely, any parallel components between the moment arm <m>\vec{r}</m> and force <m>\vec{F}</m> make a cross product equal to zero.
<me>\vec{M} = \vec{r} \times \vec{F}  = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\ihat \amp \jhat \amp \khat\\ 
{r}_{x} \amp {r}_{y} \amp 0\\ 
{F}_{x} \amp {F}_{y} \amp 0
\end{bmatrix}
\color{Peach}{
\begin{matrix}
 \ihat \amp \jhat\\ 
 {r}_{x} \amp {r}_{y} \\ 
{F}_{x} \amp {F}_{y}
\end{matrix}}
 =( {r_x}{F_y} - {r_y}{F_x})\khat</me></p>
<p/>
<p>Note that it is the perpendicular components that cause moments. </p>
<p>It is important to avoid three common mistakes in setting up the cross product.
<ul label="square"><li>The order must always be <m>\vec{r}\times\vec{F}</m>, never <m>\vec{F}\times\vec{r}</m>. Thus the moment arm <m>\vec{r}</m> appears in the middle line of the determinant and the force <m>\vec{F}</m> on the bottom line.</li><li>The moment arm <m>\vec{r}</m> must always be measured from the point of interest to the force. Never from the force to the point.</li><li>The signs of the components of <m>\vec{r}\text{ and }\vec{F}</m> must follow those of a right-hand coordinate system (covered in Ch 2). The most common right-hand coordinate system has the x-axis positive to the right, the y-axis positive upward, and the z-axis positive coming out of the screen/page.</li></ul></p>
<p>Varignon’s Theorem is a mathematical simplification of taking cross products developed by French mathematician Pierre Varignon (1654 <ndash/> 1722) which was published in 1687. It states that the sum of the moments of multiple concurrent forces (which all act through one point) is equal to the moment of the resultant of those forces. In other words, to find the moment of a series of concurrent forces about a given point, we can sum the forces first to find the resultant and then calculate the moment of that resultant about the point of interest, or compute the moment of each individual force about the point of interest and then sum those moments to find the net moment about that point.</p>
<p>Either method will give us equivalent results. </p>
<p>This can be a convenient tool if you know the Cartesian components of a force (<m>F_x</m> and <m>F_y</m>) and want to calculate the moment of that force about a point.  Varignon’s Theorem tells you that you can calculate the moment of <m>F_x</m> and <m>F_y</m> about that point individually, and then add the results to find the net moment about the point.  As an added bonus, the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> components of the position vector and the force vector are naturally perpendicular, so you do not need to apply the full cross product. Simply multiply the perpendicular components and assign signs for each moment from the right-hand rule. In the case of a two-dimensional moment this would look like:</p>
<p><md><mrow>\vec{M}=\vec{r}\times\vec{F}</mrow><mrow>\vec{M}=\vec{r}_x\times\vec{F}_y + \vec{r}_y\times\vec{F}_x</mrow></md></p>
<p>Note that fundamentally Varignon’s Theorem gives you exactly the same equation as a vector determinant, without having to set up the determinant and worry about all the terms which go to zero.</p>
<p>The interactive  below will allow you to observe the multiple ways to solve for moments that were covered in the previous sections and also let you practice finding moments using the various techniques (by hiding the solutions until after you have tried yourself).</p>

<title>Moment about a Point </title>

<objectives><introduction>
<p>Key Questions:</p></introduction><ul><li>Where does the moment arm vector \vec{r} start and end?</li><li>Why do we often use determinants to find three-dimensional moments?</li></ul></objectives>
<p>Moments exist in three-dimensional systems just like those in two-dimensional systems. The main challenge when getting these is that moments now can exist in all three component directions, as opposed to only around the Z-axis. two-dimensional moments we expressed with rotational arrows as we were looking straight at the ±Z-axis of rotation. Three-dimensional moments are shown in this book as a red double-headed arrow and can be drawn in vector space just like a force or position vector.</p>
<p>When calculating a moment about a point in three-dimensions, it is usually not convenient to find the length of the moment arm perpendicular to the Three-dimensional force. We will instead focus on the use of the cross-product determinant, which automatically applies the right-hand rule to all component combinations. </p>
<p>Recall that the position vector <m>\vec{r}</m> goes from the point you are taking the moment about to the line of action of the force. <xref ref="ggb_f9kpnaqf"/> shows what the computations and vectors look like when taking a moment about the origin of the axis system. </p><figure xml:id="ggb_f9kpnaqf">

<title>Moment about a Line</title>

<objectives><introduction>
<p>Key Questions:</p></introduction><ul><li>How can you combine a dot product and a cross product to find the moment about a line?</li><li>Why does a mixed-triple determinant give you a scalar while a cross-product determinate gives you a vector?	</li><li>Where does the moment arm vector <m>\vec{r}</m> start and end for a moment about a line problem?</li></ul></objectives>
<p>While finding the moment about a point is useful, often in mechanical systems, we are looking to compute the amount of moment caused by a force around an axis. An example of this would be the moment that an accessible door opener causes around the hinge axis of a door. To compute the moment around a line we can combine two skills you already have learned:
<ul label="square"><li>finding the moment about a point (from the previous section) and </li><li>using a dot product to determine how much of one vector is along another vector.</li></ul></p>
<p>The combined computation of the dot and cross product can either be done in two steps, or in a single step. Both techniques require three vectors which are:
<ul label="square"><li><em>Unit vector along the line of interest:</em> If your line of interest is <m>DE</m>, then you will recall that a unit vector <m>\hat{\vec{u}}_{DE}</m> is the pure direction of line <m>DE</m>.</li><li><em>Position vector:</em> The position vector <m>\vec{r}</m> goes from any point along your line of interest to any point on the line of action of the force. Any one of the infinite vectors connecting the line of interest to the line of action will give you the same answer, but practically there are just a few which line up with the problem geometry</li><li><em>Force vector:</em> This technique only allows you to find the moment for one force at a time. If you had multiple concurrent forces, you could find the resultant force first before taking the moment about the line of interest.</li></ul></p>
<p>The techniques covered below require that you find the components of these three vectors prior to starting the cross and dot products. Where we always label a moment about a point with a subscript of the point you are taking the moment around, we label a moment about a line with a subscript which is the line you are taking the moment around. Thus: </p>

<p>In some books, you will find a moment about a line labeled as <m>\vec{M_{\lambda}}</m> instead of  <m>\vec{M}_{DE}</m>. The vector equation for the magnitude of this moment about line <m>DE</m> using the two-step cross and dot product steps can be written as: <m>\vec{M}_{DE} = ( \vec{r}\times \vec{F} )\, \hat{\vec{DE}}</m></p>
<p>To streamline your calculations even further, mathematically we can combine the cross and dot product into what is known as a <term>mixed triple product</term>. In the mixed triple product we write the cross product as a determinate in the form: </p>
<p><me>
{M_{DE}} = \hat{\vec{u}}_{DE}\  \cdot \left ( \vec{r}\; \times \vec{F}\right ) = \begin{bmatrix}
{u}_{DE_x} \amp {u}_{DE_y} \amp  {u}_{DE_z}\\ 
\mathit{r}_{x} \amp \mathit{r}_{y} \amp \mathit{r}_{z}\\ 
\mathit{F}_{x} \amp \mathit{F}_{y} \amp \mathit{F}_{z}
\end{bmatrix}
</me></p>
<p>To calculate the value of the mixed triple product, evaluate the determinant of a matrix consisting of the components of the unit vector <m>\hat{\vec{u}}_{DE}</m> along the line of interest <m>DE</m> in the top row, the components of a position vector <m>\vec{r}</m> from line-of-interest <m>DE</m> to the line-of-action of force <m>\vec{F}</m> in the middle row, components of the force vector <m>\vec{F}</m> in the bottom row.</p>
<p>You may be wondering a couple things:
<ul label="square"><li>Why are we using the unit vector of DE instead of the full vector DE when taking the dot product? Recall that when taking the dot product that you end up with the projection of the first vector onto a second vector times the magnitude of the second vector. If you only want the projection of the first onto the second vector then set the second vector as a unit vector which has a length of one.</li><li>Why do we get a magnitude out of an equation which contains a cross product? You are correct that the cross product will produce a vector.  But, recall that all dot products produce a scalar, hence the result of the two-step cross and dot product is a scalar.</li><li>What does it mean if my scalar value is negative? Recall this dot product with a unit vector tell you how much of the moment vector is in the direction of the dot product and negative scalar values tell you that the direction of the moment right-hand rotational axis (analogous to your right-hand thumb) is opposite the unit vector’s direction. </li></ul></p>

<p>Key Questions:</p></introduction><ul><li>What makes a couple different than a typical <m>\vec{r}\times\vec{F}</m> moment? </li><li>Why is a couple considered a pure moment?</li><li>If a couple is applied about the point we are summing moments, does it still need to be included in the sum of moments equation?</li></ul></objectives>
<p>While the moments discussed up to this point of the chapter have all been due to a single force, there is a special type of moment called a couple which is caused by a pair forces which must be 1) equal in magnitude, 2) opposite in direction, and 3) non-collinear (not sharing the same line of action). This moment is called a couple. Couples are common in mechanics and have a unique effect that the force resultant is zero, due to the equal and opposite forces. However, the sum of the moments produced by these forces is not zero. Couples, therefore, have a tendency to produce rotational motion but no translational motion.  For this reason, couples are sometimes referred to as <q>pure moments.</q></p>
<p>Recall that the magnitude of a moment about a point depends on the magnitude of the force and the distance between the point and the force. The magnitude of a couple about a point is independent of this distance and depends instead on the perpendicular distance between the two forces. For example, consider the scenario in <xref ref="couple_invariant"/> below where two equal, opposite, and non-collinear forces form a couple on a rigid body. To calculate the magnitude of this couple about a point, we could simply calculate the moment of each force about that point and sum them together.</p>

<p>To find the resultant moment around point P we can sum the moments of each parallel force. Note that the positive and negative signs for each term in the <m>\Sigma M_P </m>equation come from the right-hand rule.</p>

<p>You will notice that <m>a</m>, which is the distance from the point P to the line of action of one of the forces drops out of the equation.  This will happen regardless of the location of point P.</p><assemblage xml:id="Chapter_04-moments-from-couples-thinking-deeper---location-independence-of-couples-box">

<title>Thinking Deeper - Location independence of couples [box]</title>


<p>The equation above proves that couples produce the same moment at every point on the body. We can also say that the external effect of couples is <em>location independent</em>. Hence, no matter where you sum moments on a body, you will get the same value moment from the couple. This finding also supports the fact that if you do not recognize that a force-couple exists in a problem, simply summing the forces and moments will give you the exact same answer as resolving the force-couple into its pure moment.</p>
<p>We will learn in Ch 8 of this book that moving a couple around on a rigid body does affect the <em>internal</em> loads (or stresses) of a body, but until then we can accept that he location of a couple does not change the <em>external</em> loading or reactions. </p></assemblage>
<p>In two dimensions couples are represented by a curved arrow indicating the direction of rotation.  Following the right-hand rule the value will be positive if the moment is counter-clockwise and negative if it is clockwise.  When you sum moments about any point on the free-body diagram, you need to include the couples in addition to all the <m>\vec{r}\times\vec{F}</m> moments. In equation form, we could express this as:</p>
<p><me>\Sigma M_P = \Sigma (\vec{r}\times\vec{F} ) + \Sigma (\vec{M}_\text{couple}) </me></p>

<title>Equivalent Transformations</title>

<objectives><introduction>
<p>Key Questions:</p></introduction><ul><li>What is an equivalent transformation?</li><li>What are some examples of equivalent transformations?</li><li>What are <em>external effects</em>?</li></ul></objectives>
<p>An <em>equivalent transformation</em> occurs when a loading on an object is replaced with another loading which has the same <em>external</em> effect on the object.  By external effect we mean the response of the body that we can see from outside, with no consideration of what happens inside it.  If the object is a free body, the external effect would be translation and rotation.   In statics, since objects are not accelerating, the external effect is the reactions at the supports required to maintain equilibrium.  In either case the external effects will be exactly the same before and after an equivalent transformation.</p>
<p>Equivalent transformation permits us to swap out one set of forces with another one without changing the fundamental physics of the situation.  This is usually done to simplify or clarify the situation, or to give you an alternate way to think about, understand, and solve a mechanics problem.</p>
<p>You already know several equivalent transformations although we have not used this terminology before.  Here are some transformations you have applied previously.</p><paragraphs>

<title>Vector Addition</title>


<p>When you add forces together using the rules of vector addition, you are performing an equivalent transformation. You can swap out two or more components and replace them with a single equivalent resultant force.  </p>
<p>Any number of <em>coincident</em> forces can be added together to produce a single resultant force. By definition, the lines of action of coincident forces all intersect at a common point. The resultant must be placed at this intersection point in order for this replacement to be equivalent.  This is because before and after the replacement, the moment about the intersection point is zero.  If the resultant was placed somewhere else, that would not be true.</p></paragraphs><paragraphs>

<title>Replacing a Force with its Component</title>


<p>Resolving forces into components is also an equivalent transformation, in fact this is just the inverse operation of vector addition. The components are usually orthogonal and in the coordinate directions, or in a given plane and perpendicular to it, but any combination of components forces that adds to the original force is equivalent.  </p><figure>

<p>In this diagram, <me> \vec{F_1} + \vec{F}_2  = \vec{F} = (F; \theta) = \langle F \cos\theta, F\sin\theta \rangle</me>. The effects of the force in the <m>x</m>, <m>y</m> and (in three dimensions the <m>z</m>) directions remains the same, and by Verignon's theorem we know that the moment these forces make about any point will also be the same.</p>
<p>An interesting special case occurs when two forces are equal and opposite and have the same line of action.  When these are added together, they cancel out, so replacing these two forces with nothing is an equivalent transformation.  The opposite is true as well, so you can make two equal and opposite forces spontaneously appear a point if you wish.</p></paragraphs><assemblage xml:id="Chapter_04-equivalent-transformations-internal-effects">

<title>Internal Effects</title>


<p>We made a point of saying that equivalent systems of force have the same <m>external</m> effect on the body.  This implies that there may be some other effects which are not the same.  As you will see in <xref ref="Chapter_08"/>, we sometimes need to consider  internal forces and moments.  These are the forces inside a body which hold all the parts of the object to each other, otherwise it would break apart and fail.  Although the external effects are the same for all equivalent systems, the internal forces depend on the specifics of how the loads are applied.</p><sidebyside width="50%"><stack>
<p>Let's imagine that you have gone off-roading and have managed to get your Jeep stuck in the mud.  You have two basic options to get it out: you can <m>pull</m> it out using the winch on the front bumper, or you can ask your friend to <m>push</m> you out with his truck.  Both methods (assuming that they apply forces with the same magnitude, direction and line of action) are statically equivalent, and both will equally move your vehicle forward.  </p></stack><image source="images/2820337726_1e3f0bcb46_c.jpg"><remix><creator href="https://www.flickr.com/people/daveseven/">Dave_7</creator><license href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">CC-BY-SA</license></remix></image></sidebyside>
<p>The difference is what might happen to your vehicle.  With one method there’s a danger that you will rip your front bumper off, with the other you might damage your rear bumper.  These are the internal effects and they depend on <em>where</em> the equivalent force is applied.  These forces are are necessary to maintain rigidity and hold the parts of the body together.</p></assemblage><paragraphs>

<title>Sliding a force along its line of action</title>


<p>Sliding a force along its line of action is an equivalent transformation because sliding a force does not change its magnitude or direction and it does not change the perpendicular distance from the line of action to any point, as a result moments do not change either. </p><figure>

<title>Replacing a couple with couple-moment or vice-versa</title>


<p>A <em>couple</em>, defined as <q>two equal and opposite forces with different lines of action,</q> produces a pure turning action that is equivalent to a concentrated moment, called the <em>couple-moment</em>.  Couples and couple-moments have no translational effect. Couple-moments are free vectors, which means that they are not bound to any point.  Their external effect is on the entire body and is the same regardless of where it is applied.</p>
<p>This means that you are free to swap out a couple for its couple-moment, or swap a couple-moment for a couple which has the same moment, and you may put the replacement anywhere on you please and it will still be equivalent.</p>
<p>The diagram shows a series of equivalent transformation of a couple.</p><figure>

<p>Concentrated moments are <em>free vectors</em>, which means that they are not bound to any particular point.  You may draw the circular arrow anywhere you like on the body. In other words moving a concentrated moment from one point to another is an equivalent transformation.  Remember though, this equivalence only applies to the external effects.  What happens inside the body definitely does depend on the specific point where the moment is applied.</p></paragraphs><paragraphs>

<title>Adding moments to produce a resultant moment</title>


<p>If more than one couple-moment or concentrated moment acts on an object the situation may be simplified by adding them together to produce one <em>resultant moment</em>,<em/><m>\vec{M}_R</m>.  The standard rules of vector addition apply.</p>
<p>In two dimensional problems moments are either clockwise or counterclockwise, so they may be considered scalar values and added algebraically.  Give counterclockwise moments a positive sign and clockwise moments a negative sign according to the right hand rule sign convention.  If this is done, the sign of the resultant moment will indicate the direction of the net moment. You can use the right hand rule to establish the direction of the moment vector, which will point into or out of the page.</p>

<p>A loading system is a combination of load forces and moments which act on an object.  It can be as simple as a single force, or as complex as a three-dimensional combination of many force and moment vectors.  </p>
<p>You will see that any loading systems may be replaced with a simpler <em>statically equivalent system</em> consisting of one <em>resultant force</em> at a specific point and one <em>resultant moment</em> by performing a series of equivalent transformations.  </p>
<p>Depending on the original loading system, the resultant force, the resultant moment, or both may be zero.  If they are both zero, it indicates that the object is in equilibrium under this load condition.  If they are non-zero, the supports will need to provide an equal and opposite reaction to put the object into equilibrium.</p>
<p>The resultant force acting on a system, <m>\vec{R}</m>, can be found from adding the individual forces, <m>\vec{F}_i</m>, such that <me>\vec{R}=\sum \vec{F} = \vec{F_1}+\vec{F_2}+\vec{F_3}+...</me>.</p>
<p/>
<p>The resultant moment, <m>\vec{M}_O</m>, about a point <m>O</m>, can be found from adding all of the moments <m>\vec{M}</m>, about that point, including both <m>\vec{r}\times\vec{F}</m> moments and concentrated moments.  </p>

<title>Force-Couple Systems</title>


<p>One transformation you might like to make is to move a force to another location.  While <em>sliding</em> a force along its line of action is fine, <em>moving</em> a force to another point changes its line of action and thus its rotational effect on the object, so is <em>not</em> an equivalent transformation.</p>
<p>Consider the cantilever beam below.  In diagram (a), the load <m>\vec{P}</m> is at the end of the beam, and in (b) it has been moved to the center.  The external effects are shown in (c) and (d).  Although the vertical reaction force is the <m>P</m> in both cases, the reaction moment at point <m>O</m> is is <m>2P\ell</m> in one case and <m>P\ell</m> in the other.</p><figure>

<p>You <em>can</em> move a force to a new line of action in an equivalent fashion if you add a <q>compensatory couple</q> to undo the effect of changing the line of action.  This can be accomplished with of a series of individual equivalent transformations as shown in the diagram below.  The result of this process is the <em>equivalent force-couple system</em> shown in diagram (d), which is statically equivalent to the original situation in (a).</p><figure>

<p>Evaluating the moment at point <m>O</m> at was an arbitrary choice.  Any other point would give the same result.  For example, in the original situation (a) force <m>P</m> makes a clockwise moment <m>M=P\ell</m> about the midpoint.  When the force is moved to the center <m>P</m> creates no moment there, so a clockwise compensatory couple with a magnitude of <m>P\ell</m> must be added to maintain equivalence. This is the same result as we found previously (d). The compensatory couple has been drawn centered around the midpoint, but this too is arbitrary because concentrated moments are free vectors and can be placed at any location.</p>

<p>Since the <m>F_1</m> and <m>F_2</m> are parallel, the magnitude of the resultant force is just the sum of the two magnitudes and it points down. <me> R = F_1 + F_2</me></p>
<p>The resultant moment about point <m>A</m> is <me> M_A = F_1 d_1 + F_2 (d_1 + d_2)</me>. </p>
<p>To create the equivalent system (b), the resultant force and resultant moment are placed at point <m>A</m>.</p>
<p>The system in (b) can be further simplified to eliminate the moment at <m>M_A</m>, by performing the process in reverse.</p>
<p>In (c) we place the resultant force <m>R</m> a  distance <m>d</m> away from point <m>A</m> such that the resultant moment around point <m>A</m> remains the same.  This distance can be found using <m>M = Fd</m>. <me>d = M_A/R</me></p>
<p>The systems in (a), (b), and (c) are all statically equivalent</p></solution><postlude>
<p>In this example, we started with two forces. We have found two different statically equivalent systems; one with a force and a couple, the other with a single force. This latter system is simpler than the original system.</p>
<p>It is important to note that static equivalence applies to external effects only. When determining internal forces, such as the shear and bending moment discussed in <xref ref="VM_diagrams"/> or when considering non-rigid bodies, the original loading system must be used.</p></postlude></investigation><paragraphs>

<title>Determining Equivalence</title>


<p>Two complex loading systems are equivalent if they reduce to the same resultant force and the same resultant moment about any arbitrary point.  </p>
<p>Two loading systems are statically equivalent if
<ul label="square"><li>The resultant forces are the equal</li><li>The resultant moments about some point are equal</li></ul></p>
<p>This process is illustrated in the following example.</p></paragraphs><investigation xml:id="Chapter_04-statically-equivalent-systems-example-finding-statically-equivalent-loads">

<title>Strategy</title>


<p>Evaluate the resultant force and resultant moment for each case and compare.  We choose to evaluate the resultant moment about point A, though any other point would work.</p></paragraphs><paragraphs>

<title>For system (a)</title>


<p><md><mrow>\vec{R} \amp = \langle -10,0 \rangle \lb{}</mrow><mrow>\vec{M_A} \amp =-80+6(10)</mrow><mrow>\amp = \ftlb{-20}</mrow></md></p></paragraphs><paragraphs>

<title>For system (b)</title>


<p><md><mrow>\vec{R}\amp=\langle -20+10,0 \rangle \lb{} </mrow><mrow>\amp = \langle -10,0 \rangle \lb{}</mrow><mrow>\vec{M}_A\amp= -120+12(20)-6(10)</mrow><mrow>\amp = \ftlb{60}</mrow></md></p></paragraphs><paragraphs>

<title>For system (c)</title>


<p><md><mrow>\vec{R} \amp =\langle -10,0 \rangle \lb{}</mrow><mrow>\vec{M}_A \amp=-40+20+0(10) </mrow><mrow>\amp = \ftlb{-20}</mrow></md></p></paragraphs>
<p>Systems (a) and (c) are statically equivalent since <m>\vec{R}</m> and <m>\vec{M}_A</m> are the same in both cases. System (b) is not as its resultant moment is different than the other two. </p></solution></investigation>
<p>Any load system can be simplified to its resultant force, <m>\vec{R}</m>, and resultant couple, <m>\vec{M}</m>, acting at any arbitrary point, <m>O</m>. There are four common special cases which are worth highlighting individually.</p><paragraphs>

<title>Concurrent forces</title>


<p>When all forces in a system are concurrent, the resultant moment about that their common intersection point will always be zero.</p>
<p>We need only to find the resultant force and place it at the point of intersection. </p>
<p>The resultant moment about any other point is the moment of the resultant force <m>\vec{R}</m> about that point.</p></paragraphs><paragraphs>

<title>Parallel forces</title>


<p>When all forces in a system are parallel, the resultant force will act in this direction with a magnitude equal to the sum of the individual magnitudes. There will be no moment created about this axis, but we need to find the resultant moment about the other two rectangular axes. That is, if all forces act in the <m>x</m> direction, we need only find the resultant force in the <m>x</m> direction and the resultant moment about the <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> axes.</p></paragraphs><paragraphs>

<title>Coplanar forces</title>


<p>When all forces in a system are coplanar we need only find the resultant force in this plane and the resultant moment about the axis perpendicular to this plane. That is, if all forces exist in the <m>x</m>-<m>y</m> plane, we need only to sum components in the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> directions to find resultant force \vec{R}, and use these to determine the resultant moment about the <m>z</m> axis. All two-dimensional problems fall into this category.</p></paragraphs><paragraphs>

<title>Wrench resultant</title>


<p>A wrench resultant is a special case where the resultant moment acts around the axis of the resultant force. The directions of the resultant force vector and the resultant moment vector are the same.</p><sidebyside widths="30% 70%"><figure>

<p>For example, if the resultant force is only in the <m>x</m> direction and the resultant moment acts only around the <m>x</m> axis, this is an example of a wrench resultant. An everyday example is a screwdriver, where both the resultant force and axis of rotation are in-line with the screwdriver. A wrench resultant is considered positive if the couple vector and force vector point in the same direction, and negative if they point in opposite directions.</p></sidebyside>
<p>Any force-couple system may be reduced to an equivalent wrench resultant even if the resultant force and resultant moment do not initially form a wrench resultant. </p>
<p>To find the equivalent wrench resultant: 
<ol><li>First, find the resultant force <m>\vec{R}</m> and resultant moment <m>\vec{M}</m> at an arbitrary at arbitrary point, <m>O</m>. These need not act along the same axis.</li><li>Resolve the resultant moment into scalar components <m>M_\parallel</m> and <m>M_\perp</m>, parallel and perpendicular to the axis of the resultant force.</li><li>Eliminate <m>M_\perp</m> by moving the the resultant force away from point <m>O</m> by distance <m>d =  M_\perp/R</m></li></ol></p>
<p>The simplified system consists of  moment <m>\vec{M}_\parallel</m> and  force <m>\vec{R}</m> and acting distance <m>d</m> away from point <m>O</m>. Since <m>\vec{R}</m> and  <m>\vec{M}_\parallel</m> act along the same axis, the system has been reduced to a wrench resultant. Wrench resultants are the most general way to represent a complex force-couple system, but their utility is limited.</p></paragraphs></section></chapter>
