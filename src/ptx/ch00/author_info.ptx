<title>Overview</title>

<p>by William Haynes @weh</p>
<p>We will be authoring the Engineering Statics book using <url href="https://pretextbook.org"><pretext/></url>,  storing  the text, images and interactives on at <url href="github.com">GitHub</url> using <url href="https://git-scm.com">git</url>, and converting everything into a website and a pdf book using <url href="https://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/">XSLT</url>.  Finally we will post everything it on our <url href="https://EngineeringStatics.org">website</url> for students to use.</p>
<p><pretext/> consists of two pieces, the XML markup and the XSLT processor.</p>
<p>The source documents for the book are text files marked up using XML tags, similar to the way  HTML documents are  marked up, but the tags are specific to the requiements of academic textbooks.   We will be using the extension .ptx to indicate <pretext/> files.  The <pretext/> tags are formally defined by an <url href="https://pretextbook.org/doc/schema-litprog/pretext.pdf">XML Schema</url>, which specifies what are legal tags and where they can be used.</p>
<p>Most likely you will want to see what the final result of your writing looks like.  In order to see it in its final version,  you can compile it with XSLT to create a local copy of the final version</p>

<title>Workflow</title>

<p>The main components necessary to make this all work are: </p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Local copies of the <pretext/> and Engineering Statics files</li>
<li>An XML aware text editor to edit the <pretext/> source.</li>
<li>The command line program git and a GitHub account.</li>
<li>An XSLT processor to convert the source text to html</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>When you have these installed and working on your computer, you will have everything you need to produce a local copy of the entire book. That way, you can edit something and then test it to see what it will look like in its final form.  When you are satisfied with your work, you will use git to send it to the GitHub, where Dan or Will will integrate it into its proper place in the book, publish and upload to the website.  </p>
<p>If this sounds daunting to you, don't worry!  <em>You don't have to do any of this while you create your first draft</em>.  Please just write! Use any tools you are comfortable with, and I (@weh) will do the initial markup to <pretext/> for you.  However, marking up the the draft is a one way trip.  After that, any further edits and improvements must be made on the <pretext/> source.   Don't spend any effort trying to make your draft look pretty because all styling will be handled by <pretext/>.</p>

<title>Getting set up</title>

<p>The <url href="https://pretextbook.org"><pretext/></url> website has plenty of information on how  to get started with <pretext/>.  You will find quickstart instructions on the homepage which may be all you need as well as more detailed instuctions and walkthrough videos.</p>

<p><url href="https://pretextbook.org/doc/pnw/html/novices.html"><pretext/> for Novices Using Windows</url> has a detailed description of how to install the necessary tools.</p>
<p><url href="https://pretextbook.org/doc/guide/html/"><pretext/> Guide</url> is the place to learn about <pretext/> and get started.</p>

<title>Pretext tags</title>

<p>Here is a list of commonly used <pretext/> tags. Their purposes are mostly self evident. </p>
<p>For details on the use of tags see Chapter 3 of the <url href="https://pretextbook.org/doc/author-guide/html/overview.html">Author's Guide</url>.</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li> book</li>
<li> title</li>
<li> chapter</li>
<li> section</li>
<li> subsection</li>
<li> subsubsection</li>
<li> introduction</li>
<li> conclusion</li>
<li> objectives</li>
<li> example</li>
<li> exercises</li>
<li> exercise</li>
<li> hint</li>
<li> solution</li>
<li> aside</li>
<li> note</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li> <tag>p</tag> <mdash/> basic paragraph, like html</li>
<li> <tag>paragraph</tag> <mdash/> a paragraph with a title</li>
<li> <tag>em</tag> <mdash/> emphasis, renders as italics</li>
<li> <tag>figure</tag> <mdash/> a numbered figurs</li>
<li> <tag>image</tag> <mdash/> contains filename of associated image file</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Mathematics is described in the <url href="https://pretextbook.org/doc/author-guide/html/overview-math.html">Author's Guide</url></p>
<p>
<ul>
<li> <tag>m</tag> <mdash/> inline math, uses LaTeX syntax, rendered with MathJax .</li>
<li> <tag>me</tag> <mdash/> single equation, centered</li>
<li> <tag>md</tag> <mdash/> display math, multiline </li>
<li> <tag>men</tag> <mdash/> numbered equation</li>
<li> <tag>mdn</tag> <mdash/> numbered display math</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The <url href="https://pretextbook.org/doc/schema/"><pretext/> Schema</url> describes the <pretext/> vocabulary: the legal tags and how they nest. It's formal and confusing, so you may be better off looking at the source of documents that do what you want first. Another reference is and the <url href="https://pretextbook.org/doc/schema-litprog/pretext.pdf">Schema documentation</url> which describes the schema </p>
</subsection>


<p>I'll try to list all customizations an non-standard <pretext/> behaviors that I have implemented here.</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>I've redefined latex \vec{} to produce bold face in with a macro in docinfo.ptx so \vec{A} will produce <m>\vec{A}</m> </li>
</ul>
</p>
