<li>How does the centroid of an area relate to the center of gravity of an object?</li></ul></objectives><introduction>
<p>A <term>centroid</term> is the geometric center of a geometric object: a one-dimensional curve, a two-dimensional area or a three-dimensional volume. Centroids are useful for many situations in Statics and subsequent courses, including the analysis of distributed forces, beam bending, and shaft torsion.</p>
<p>Two related concepts are the <term>center of gravity</term>, which is the average location of an object’s <em>weight</em>, and the <term>center of mass</term> which is the average location of an object’s <em>mass</em>.  In many engineering situations, the centroid, center of mass, and center of gravity are all coincident. Because of this, these three terms are often used interchangeably without regard to their precise meanings.</p>
<p>We consciously and subconsciously use centroids for many things in life and engineering, including:
<ol>
<li><em>Keeping your body’s balance:</em> Try standing up with your feet together and leaning your head and hips in front of your feet. You have just moved your body’s center of gravity out of line with the support of your feet.</li>
<li><em>Computing the stability of objects in motion like cars, airplanes, and boats:</em> By understanding how the center of gravity interacts with the accelerations caused by motion, we can compute design speeds like those for sharp curves on a highway.</li>
<li><em>Designing the structural support to balance the structure’s own weight and applied loadings on buildings, bridges, and dams:</em> We design most large infrastructure not to move. To keep it from moving, we must understand how the structure’s weight, people, vehicles, wind, earth pressure, and water pressure balance with the structural supports.</li></ol></p>
<p>You probably have already developed a good intuition about centroids and centers of gravity based upon your life experience, and can roughly estimate their location when you look at an object or diagram.  In this chapter you will learn to locate them precisely using two techniques: <xref ref="centroids-by-integration">integration</xref> and the method of <xref ref="composite-parts"> composite parts</xref>.</p><!--todo: figure out how to make an 'inline image' for the Center of Gravity symbol --></introduction><section xml:id="weghted-average">

<title>Weighted Averages</title>


<p>You certainly know how to find the average of several numbers by adding them up and dividing by the number of values, so for example the average of the first four positive integers is <me>\frac{1+2+3+4}{4} = 2.5</me></p>
<p>More formally, if <m>a</m> is a set with <m>n</m> elements, then the average, or <alert>mean</alert> value is <men>\bar{a} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n a_i = \frac{a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_n}{n} </men>. The bar over the <m>a</m> indicates that this is a mean value. This average is also called the <term>arithmetic mean</term>. When calculating an arithmetic mean, each number is equally important when evaluating the average.  </p>
<p>In situations where some values are more important than others, we use a <term>weighted average</term>. A familiar example is your grade point average. Your GPA is calculated by weighting your grade for each class by the credits for that class, then dividing by the total credits you have taken.  The credit values are called the <term>weighting factors</term>. </p>
<p>In general terms a weighted average is <men xml:id="weighted-average">\bar{a} = \frac{\sum a_i w_i}{\sum {w_i}} </men> Where <m>a_i</m> are the values we are averaging and <m>w_i</m> are the corresponding weighting factors.  The weighting factors are different for each item being averaged, so <m>w_i</m> is the weighting factor for value <m>a_i</m>. In this book we will not write the limits on the sums, and understand that the intent is always to sum over all the values.   Notice that if the weighting factors are all identical, they can be factored out of the sums so the weighted average and the arithmetic mean will be the same.</p>
<p>Weighted averaging is used to find centroids, centers of gravity and centers of mass, the subject of this chapter.   All three are <em>points</em> located at the <q>center</q> the object, but the meaning of <q>center</q> depends on the weighting factors. Area or volume are the factors used for centroids, weight for center of gravity, and mass for center of mass. </p><investigation xml:id="weghted-average-course-grades">

<title>Center of Gravity</title>


<p>So far in this book we have always taken the weight of an object to act at a point at its center. This is the <term>center of gravity</term>: the point where all of an object's weight may be concentrated and still have the same <em>external</em> effect on the body.    In this chapter we will learn to actually locate this point.</p><sidebyside widths="90% 8%" valign="middle">
<p>We will indicate the center of gravity with a circle with black and white quadrants, and we will use <m>(\bar{x}, \bar{y})</m> as the coordinates of this point.  This represents the average location of all the particles which make up the body.  The same symbols are also used for centroids, and <m>\bar{z}</m> is used as well for three-dimensional problems. </p><image source="images/cg_symbol"/></sidebyside>
<p>The center of gravity of a body is fixed with respect to the body, but the coordinates depend on the choice of coordinate system. For example, in <xref ref="centroid_def"/>  the center of gravity of the block is at its geometric center meaning that <m>\bar{x}</m> and <m>\bar{y}</m> are positive, but if the block is moved to the left of the <m>y</m> axis, or the coordinate system is translated to the right of the block, <m>\bar{x}</m> would then become negative. </p>
<p/><figure xml:id="centroid_def">

<p>Lets explore the center of gravity of a familiar object.  Take a pencil and try to balance it on your finger.  How do you decide where to place it? You likely supported it roughly in the middle, then adjusted it until it balanced. You found the point where the moments of the weights on either side of your finger were in equilibrium. </p>
<p>Let's develop this balanced moment idea mathematically.  </p>
<p>Assume that the two halves of the pencil have known weights acting at points 1 and 2. How could we replace the two weights with a single statically equivalent force?   Recall from <xref ref="statically-equivalent-systems"/> that statically equivalent systems produce the same external effect on the object  <mdash/>the net force on the object, and the net moment about any point don't change.  An upward force at this point will support the pencil without tipping.</p>
<p>To be equivalent, the total weight must equal the total weight of the parts. <m>W = W_1 + W_2</m>. Common sense also tells us that <m>W</m> will act somewhere between <m>W_1</m> and <m>W_2</m>.</p>
<p/><figure xml:id="pen1">

<p> Next, let's do the mathematical equivalent of sliding your finger back and forth until a balance point is located. Pick any point <m>O</m> to be the origin, then calculate the total moment about <m>O</m> due to the two weights.</p><figure xml:id="pen3">

<p>The sum of moments around point <m>O</m> can be written as:</p>
<p><me>\sum M_O=-x_1 W_1 -x_2 W_2</me></p>
<p>Notice that the moment of both forces are clockwise around point <m>O</m>, so the signs are negative according to the right-hand rule. We want  a single equivalent force acting at the (unknown) center of gravity. Call the distance from the origin to the the center of gravity <m>\bar{x}</m>.  </p>
<p><m>\bar{x}</m> represents the mean distance of the weight, mass, or area depending on the context of the problem. We are evaluating weights in this problem, so <m>\bar{x}</m> represents the distance from <m>O</m> to the center of gravity.</p>

<p>The sum of moments around point <m>O</m> for the equivalent system can be written as:
<me>\sum  M_O=-\bar{x} W</me></p>
<p>The moment of total weight <m>W</m> is also clockwise around point <m>O</m>, so the sign of moment will also be negative according to the right-hand rule. Since the two representation are equivalent we can equate them and solve for <m>\bar{x}</m>.

<p/>
<p>This result is exactly in the form of <xref ref="weighted-average"/> where the value being averaged is distance <m>x</m> and the weighting factor is is the weight of part <m>W_i</m> and the result is the mean distance <m>\bar{x}</m>.</p>
<p>The pencil was made up of two halves, but this equation can easily be extended <m>n</m> discrete parts. The resulting general definition of the centroidal coordinate <m>\bar{x}</m> is:
<men>\bar{x}=\frac{\sum  \bar{x}_{i} W_i}{\sum  W_i}</men> where: 
<ul label="square">
<li><m>W_i</m> is the weight of part <m>i</m>, </li>
<li><m>\bar{x}_{i}</m> is the <m>x</m> coordinate of the center of gravity of element <m>i</m>, and</li>
<li><m>\sum</m> is understood to mean <q>sum all parts</q> so there is no need to write <m>\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n</m>. </li></ul></p>
<p>The numerator is called <term>first moment </term>of force and is literally a moment of force as we defined it in <xref ref="Chapter_03"/>.  In other weighted averages we will see first moments of mass and first moments of area, and later in <xref ref="Chapter_10"/> we will see <term>second moments</term>, which are force, mass or area multiplied by a distance squared. The denominator is the sum of the weighting factors, which is the total weight of the object.</p>
<p>We treated the pencil as a one-dimensional object, so this discussion focused on <m>\bar{x}</m>.  There are similar formula for the other dimensions as well 
<men xml:id="center_of_gravity">
\bar{x}=\frac{\sum  \bar{x}_{i} W_i}{\sum  W_i} \quad \bar{y}=\frac{\sum  \bar{y}_{i} W_i}{\sum  W_i} \quad \bar{z}=\frac{\sum   \bar{z}_{i} W_i}{\sum  W_i}
</men>.</p>
<p/>
<p>In words, these equations say <me>\text{distance to CG}=\frac{\text{sum of first moments of weight}}{\text{total weight}}</me></p>
<p>They apply to any object which can be divided into discrete parts, and they produce the coordinates of the object’s center of gravity.  </p><question><statement>
<p>Can you explain why the center of gravity of a symmetrical object will always fall on the axis of symmetry?</p></statement><answer>
<p>If the object is symmetrical, every subpart on the positive side of the axis of symmetry will be balanced by an identical part on the negative side.  The first moment for the entire shape about the axis will sum to zero, meaning that <me>\bar{x} = \frac{\sum  \bar{x}_{i} W_i}{\sum  W_i} = \frac{0}{W} = 0 </me>.  In other words, the distance from the axis of symmetry of the shape to the centroid is zero.</p></answer></question><investigation xml:id="Chapter_07-center-of-gravity-example">

<title>Center of Mass</title>


<p>The <term>center of mass</term> is the mean location of the mass of an object, and is related to the center of gravity by Newton's Second Law because <me>W = mg</me>, where <m>g</m> is the local strength of the gravitational field. In this course you may take <m>g = \aSI{9.81}</m> as a reasonable assumption for objects on the surface of the earth.</p>
<p>Substituting <m>m_i\ g = W_i</m> in <xref ref="center_of_gravity"/> gives the equations for the center of mass.

<p>On earth, the value of <m>g</m> is a constant, in which case it can be factored out of the sums and it drops out of the equation completely.

<li>When will the centroid, center of gravity and center of mass refer to the same point</li>
<li>Why do the equations for the center of gravity, mass, volume, and area all have the same structure?</li></ul></objectives><introduction>
<p>A centroid is a weighted average like the center of gravity, but weighted with a geometric property like area or volume, and not a physical property like weight or mass.  This means that centroids are properties of pure shapes, not physical objects.  They represent the coordinates of the <q>middle</q> of the shape.</p>
<p>The defining equations for centroids are similar to the equations for<xref ref="center_of_gravity">Centers of Gravity</xref> but with <em>volume</em>  used as the weighting factor for three-dimensional shapes 
<men xml:id="threed_centroid">
\bar{x}=\frac{\sum  \bar{x}_{i} V_i}{\sum  V_i} \quad \bar{y}=\frac{\sum  \bar{y}_{i} V_i}{\sum  V_i} \quad \bar{z}=\frac{\sum   \bar{z}_{i} V_i}{\sum  V_i}

<men xml:id="twod_centroid">
\bar{x}=\frac{\sum  \bar{x}_{i} A_i}{\sum  A_i} \quad \bar{y}=\frac{\sum  \bar{y}_{i} A_i}{\sum  A_i}
</men>.</p>
<p>We will see how to use these equations on complex shapes later in this chapter, but centroids of some simple shapes can be easily found using symmetry.</p>
<p>If the shape has an axis of symmetry, every point on one side of the axis is mirrored by another point equidistant on the other side.   One has a positive distance from the axis, and the other is the same distance away in the negative direction.  These two points will add to zero the numerator, as will every other point making up the shape, and the first moment will be zero. This means that the centroid must lie along the line of symmetry if there is one. If a shape has multiple symmetry lines, then the centroid must exist at their intersection.</p><image width="50%" source="images/symmetry.png"/>
<p>Since rectangles, circles, cubes, spheres, <etc/> have multiple lines of symmetry, their centroids must be exactly in the center as we would expect.</p><!--todo add diagrams for centroid of rectangles and circles here --><question><statement>

<title>Relations between Centroids and Center of gravity</title>


<p>The equations we have been discussing <xref ref="center_of_gravity"/>, <xref ref="center_of_mass"/>,<xref ref="three_d_centroid"/> and <xref ref="two_D_centroid"/> are all variations on the general weighted average formula <xref ref="weighted-average"/>.
<me>\bar{a} = \frac{\sum a_i w_i}{\sum {w_i}}</me></p>
<p>Here <m>a_i</m> represents the distance in one of the coordinate directions such as <m>x</m>, <m>\bar{a}</m> is the mean distance in the <m>a</m> direction to the <sq>middle</sq> of the whole object, and <m>w</m> is the weighting factor.  The only difference between them is the choice of weighting factor.  For center of gravity, the weighting factor is the weight, for center of mass, it is the mass, for 3D Centroids it is the volume, and for 2D Centroids it is area. </p>
<p>To understand how these equations relate to one another consider a plate with a cross-sectional area <m>A</m>, and a height <m>t</m> divided into <m>n</m> pieces with volume <m>V_i</m>.</p><figure xml:id="flat-plate">

<p>The weight of part <m>i</m> is the product of its specific weight and volume.
<me>W_i = \gamma V_i = \rho g A_i t</me></p>
<p>In the most general case, all of these terms might depend on the position of the part, but if any are constant they can be factored out and simplify the formulas.  </p>
<p>For example, on earth we can take the acceleration of gravity as the constant <m>g = aSI{9.81}</m>, and so the center of gravity and center of mass become one and the same point.
<md><mrow>\bar{x}\amp = \frac{\sum  \bar{x}_{i} W_i}{\sum  W_i} \amp \bar{y}\amp = \frac{\sum  \bar{y}_{i} W_i}{\sum  W_i} \amp \bar{z}\amp = \frac{\sum   \bar{z}_{i} W_i}{\sum  W_i}

<p>For more complex shapes, the usual practice is to set up a table to organize the information needed to calculate the centroid, as we will now show.  The process can be broken into three steps.</p>
<p><ol>
<li xml:id="-break-the-overall-shape-into-simpler-parts">

<title>Break the overall shape into simpler parts</title>


<p>We begin with a sketch of the shape and establish a coordinate system.  It is critical that all measurements are made from a common origin, and the results will be measured from this origin as well.  A careful choice of origin can simplify the problem, so give it some thought.</p>
<p>Then divide the shape into several simpler shapes.  The sub-shapes may include holes, which are treated as negative areas.  You must know how to calculate the area and locate the centroid of any sub-shape you use.  </p>
<p>Consider the complex shape below. </p><image width="75%" source="images/composite-example.png"/>
<p>There are often several ways to divide a shape, but it's best to use as few parts as possible to minimize your computations and opportunities for error.  For example, you could choose to break this shape into either
<ul label="square">
<li>a <m>\cm{5} \times \cm{4}</m> rectangle, a <m>\cm{6} \times \cm{4}</m> right triangle, and an <m>r = \cm{1.5}</m> circular hole, or </li>
<li>a large <m>\cm{10} \times \cm{4}</m> rectangle,  an <m>r = \cm{1.5}</m>  circular hole, and a <m>\cm{6} \times \cm{4}</m> right triangle subtracted from the large rectangle.</li></ul></p>
<p>Both options will give the same results, and in this case there is no particular advantage to one choice over the other.  However, it would be silly and unnecessary to break this into more than three parts, and it would not be a good idea to divide this into a trapezoid minus a hole, unless you know geometric properties of a trapezoid <mdash/> which are not available in <xref ref="centroid-table"/>.  Be sure your sub shapes don’t overlap and don’t get counted more than once.</p>
<p/></li>
<li xml:id="-collect-the-areas-and-centroid-coordinates">

<title>Collect the areas and centroid coordinates</title>


<p>Once the complex shape has been divided into parts, the next step is to determine the area and centroidal coordinates for each part.  You can use the properties in <xref ref="centroid-table"/> for rectangles, triangles, circles, semi-circles and quarter circles but you will need to use integration if other shapes are involved. Any holes or removed shapes should be treated as negative areas.</p>
<p>Record the information you gather in a table like the one below.  The table should include a row containing column headings and units, one row for each part, and a summary row.  The first column identifies the part <mdash/> by number or sketch, the second contains the areas, and the third and fourth contains the centroidal coordinates of the parts.  </p><tabular halign="center">

<p>The last two columns of the table contain the first moments of area  <m>Q_x = A_i \bar{y}_i</m> and <m>Q_y =  A_i \bar{x}_i</m>, and are easily filled in by multiplying the values in columns two to four.  Be sure to attend to positive and negative signs when multiplying. Note that the moment of area with respect to the <m>x</m> axis uses the distance from the <m>x</m> axis, which is <m>\bar{y}_i</m>, and vice-versa.</p>
<p>The final row of the table are total values, calculated by summing the entries for <m>A_i</m>, <m>Q_x</m> and <m>Q_y</m>, so for example the total area of the shape is <me>A = \sum A_i = A_1 + A_2 + A_3 \dots</me>  Don’t sum columns three or four, since <m>\sum \bar{x}_i</m> and <m>\sum \bar{y}_i</m> are meaningless.</p></li>

<title>Average Value of a Function</title>


<p>The weighted average technique discussed in <xref ref="weighted-average"/> are a fine for averaging several discrete values, but what do we do if we need to find the average of an infinite number of values or values which change continuously?  </p>
<p>Consider a function <m>y=f(x)</m> over some interval from <m>a</m> to <m>b</m>.  How can we find the average value <m>\bar{y}</m> of the function over that interval? </p>

<p>The area under this curve between <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> is shaded with gray.  The blue hatched rectangle has the same area as the gray shaded region.  Because the areas are the same, the height of the rectangle represents is average value of the function. </p><figure xml:id="function-average">

<title>Integration Process</title>


<p>Determining the centroid of a area using integration involves finding weighted average values <m>\bar{x}</m> and <m>\bar{y}</m>, by evaluating three integrals,
<mdn><mrow xml:id="centroid_eqn">A \amp = \int dA, \amp Q_x\amp =\int \bar{y}_{el}\ dA, \text{and} \amp  Q_y \amp = \int \bar{x}_{el}\ dA</mrow></mdn>, where
<ul>
<li>
<p><m>dA</m> is a differential bit of area called the <em>element</em>.</p></li>
<li>
<p><m>A</m> is the <em>total area</em> enclosed by the shape, and is found by evaluating the first integral.</p></li>
<li>
<p><m>\bar{x}_{el}</m> and <m>\bar{y}_{el}</m> are the coordinates of the <em>centroid of the element</em>.  These will normally be functions of <m>x</m> or <m>y</m>.</p></li>
<li>
<p><m>Q_x</m> and <m>Q_y</m> are the <term/><em>First moment of Area</em> with respect to the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> axis.</p></li></ul></p>
<p>The procedure for finding centroids with integration can be broken into three steps: <ol>
<li xml:id="-set-up-the-integrals">

<title>Set up the integrals</title>


<p>Usually this is the hardest step.  </p>
<p>You should always begin by drawing a sketch of the problem and reviewing the given information. </p>
<p>You will need to understand the boundaries of the shape, which may be lines or functions.  You may need to know some math facts, like the definition of slope, or the equation of a line or parabola.  A bounding function  may be given as a function of <m>x</m>, but you want it as a function of <m>y,</m> or vice-versa or it may have a constant which you will need to determine.</p>
<p>You will need to choose an element of area <m>dA</m>.  There are several choices available, including vertical strips, horizontal strips, or square elements; or in polar coordinates, rings, wedges or squares. There really is no right or wrong choice; they will all work, but one may make the integration easier than another. The best choice depends on the nature of the problem, and it takes some experience to predict which it will be.</p><figure>

<caption>Differential Elements of Area</caption>

<sidebyside widths="30% 60%"><image width="20%" source="images/squareda.png"/><image width="50%" source="images/strips.png"/></sidebyside></figure>
<p>The two most common choices for differential elements are: 
<ul>
<li>

<title>Square elements and double integrals</title>


<p>If you choose an infinitesimal square element <m>dA = dx\;dy</m>, you must integrate twice, over <m>x</m> and over <m>y</m> between the appropriate integration limits.  The position of the element typically designated <m>(x,y)</m>.</p></li>
<li>

<title>Rectangular elements and single integrals</title>


<p>If you choose rectangular elements you eliminate the need to integrate twice.  You may select a vertical element with a different width <m>dx</m>, and a height extending from the lower to the upper bound, or a horizontal strip with a differential height <m>dy</m> and a width extending from the left to the right boundaries.  Either way, you only integrate once to cover the enclosed area.</p>
<p>When finding the area enclosed by a single function <m>y=f(x)</m>, and the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> axes <m>(x,y)</m> represents a point on the function and  <m>dA = y\ dx</m> for vertical strips, or <m>dA = x\ dy</m> for horizontal strips.</p></li></ul></p>
<p>You must find expressions for the area <m>dA</m> and centroid of the element <m>(\bar{x}_{el}, \bar{y}_{el})</m> in terms of the bounding functions. This is how we turn an integral over an area into a definite integral which can be integrated.</p>
<p>When you have established  all these items, you can substitute them into <xref ref="centroid_eqn"/> and proceed to the integration step.</p></li>
<li xml:id="-solve-the-integrals">

<title>Solve the integrals</title>


<p>This step is pure mathematics.</p>
<p>Here are some tips if you are doing integration <q>by hand</q>. Be neat,  work carefully, and check your work as you go along. Use proper mathematics notation: don't lose the differential <m>dx</m> or <m>dy</m> before the integration step, and don't include it afterwords.  Don't forget to use equals signs between steps.  Simplify as you go and don't substitute numbers or other constants too soon.  Pay attention to units: Area <m>A</m> should have units of <m>[\text{length}]^3</m> and the first moments of area <m>Q_x</m> and <m>Q_y</m> should have units of <m>[\text{length}]^3</m>. If your units aren't consistent, then you have made a mistake.</p></li>

<p>After you have evaluated the integrals you will have expressions or values for <m>A</m>, <m>Q_x</m>, and <m>Q_y</m>.

<title>Thinking Deeper: What is <m>dA</m>?</title>


<p><m>dA</m> is just an area, but an extremely tiny one.  It's an example of an <term>differential quantity</term><mdash/><term/>also called an <term>infinitesimal</term>.  A differential quantity is value which is as close to zero as it can possibly be without actually being zero.  You can think of its value as <m>\frac{1}{\infty}</m> if you like. Integration is the process of adding up an infinite number of infinitesimal quantities.</p>
<p>Some other differential quantities we will see in statics are <m>dx</m>, <m>dy</m> and <m>dz</m>, which are infinitesimal increments of distance; <m>dV</m>, which is a differential volume; <m>dW</m>, a differential weight; <m>dm</m>, a differential mass, and so on.  </p>
<p>Any product involving a differential quantity is itself a differential quantity, so if the area of a vertical strip is given by <m>dA =y\ dx</m> then, even though height <m>y</m> is a real number, the area is a differential because <m>dx</m> is differential.  </p>
<p>If you like, you can pronounce the <m>d</m> as <q>the little bit of</q> so <m>dA = y\ dx</m> reads <q>The little bit of area is the height <m>y</m> times a little bit x.</q> and <m>A = \int dA</m> reads <q>The total area is the sum of the little bits of area.</q></p></assemblage></subsection><subsection xml:id="centroids-by-integration-area-of-a-general-spandrel">

<title>Area of a General Spandrel</title>


<p>In this section we will use the integration process describe above to calculate the area of the general spandrel shown in <xref ref="general-spandrel"/>. A <term>spandrel</term> is the area between a curve and a rectangular frame.  This is a general spandrel because the curve is defined by the function <m>y = k x^n</m>, where   <m>n</m> is not specified.  If <m>n = 0</m> this is a constant function, if <m>n=1</m> this is a straight line, <m>n=2</m> is a parabola, <etc/>. You can change the slider to see the effect of different values of <m>n</m>.</p>
<p>but the diagram indicates that the function passes through the origin <m>(0,0)</m> and an arbitrary point <m>(a,b)</m>.</p><!--todo  This needs a geogebra applet to illustrate --><!--todo  This needs to be reformulated as an example --><figure xml:id="general-spandrel">

<p>Begin by identifying the bounding functions.  From the diagram, the boundaries  are 1) the spandrel, 2) the <m>x</m> axis and, 3) the vertical line <m>x = b</m>.  In the function <m>y=kx^n</m>, constant <m>k</m> has not been specified, but it is not arbitrary. The diagram indicates that the function passes through point <m>(a,b)</m>. There is only one value of <m>k</m> which will cause this, and we can find it by substituting <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> into the function for <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> then solving for <m>k</m>.
<md><mrow>y \amp =  k x^n</mrow><mrow>b \amp =  k a^n</mrow><mrow>k \amp =  \frac{b}{a^n}</mrow></md></p>
<p>Next, choose a differential area.  For this problem a vertical strip works well.  A vertical strip has a width <m>dx</m>, and extends from the bottom boundary to the top boundary.  Any point on the curve is <m>(x,y)</m> and a point directly below it on the <m>x</m> axis is <m>(x,0)</m>.  This means that the height of the strip is <m>(y-0) = y</m> and the area of the strip is (base <m>\times</m> height), so <me>dA =y\ dx</me>.  </p>
<p>The limits on the integral are from <m>x=0</m> on the left to <m>x=a</m> on the right since we are integrating with respect to <m>x</m>.</p>
<p>With these details established, the next step is to set up and evaluate the integral <m>A = \int dA = \int_0^a y\ dx</m>. This is the familiar formula from calculus for the area under a curve.  Proceeding with the integration
<md><mrow>A \amp =  \int_0^a y\ dx </mrow><mrow>\amp =  \int_0^a k x^n dx \amp \left(y = kx^n\right)</mrow><mrow>\amp =  k \left . \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} \right \vert_0^a  \amp \text{(integrate)}</mrow><mrow>\amp =  k \frac{a^{n+1}}{n+1}  \amp \text{(evaluate limits)}</mrow><mrow>\amp =  \frac{b}{a^n} \frac{a^{n+1}}{n+1}  \amp  \left(k =  \frac{b}{a^n}\right)</mrow><mrow>A \amp =  \frac{ab}{n+1} \amp \text{(simplify)}</mrow></md></p>
<p>This result is not a number, but a general formula for the area under a curve in terms of <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>n</m>.  Explore with the interactive, and notice for instance that when <m>n=0</m>, the shape is a rectangle and <m>A = ab</m>; when <m>n=1</m> the shape is a triangle and the <m>A =  ba/2</m>; when <m>n=2</m> the shape is a parabola and <m>A = bh/3</m> etc.  This single formula give the equation for the area under a whole family of curves.</p><assemblage xml:id="centroids-by-integration-area-of-a-general-spandrel-thinking-deeper-which-is-better-horizontal-or-vertical-elements">

<title>Thinking Deeper: Which is better, horizontal or vertical elements?</title>

<!--todo  This section needs work.  The interactive shows a important case not discussed here, but interactives aren't valid in assemblages, so maybe put this into an example-->
<p>Recall that the first moment of area  <m>Q_x = \int \bar{x}_{el}\ dA</m> is the distance weighted area as measured from a desired axis. The distance term  <m>\bar{x}_{el}</m>  is the the distance from the desired axis to the centroid of each differential element of area, <m>dA</m>.</p>
<p>If you're using a single integral with a <em>vertical</em> element <m>dA</m>, as shown in the left image below,  
<me>dA = \underset{height}{y(x)}\ \underset{base}{dx}</me>

and the horizontal distance from the <m>y</m> axis to the centroid of <m>dA</m> would simply be
<me>\bar{x}_{el}=x</me></p>
<p/>
<p>It is also possible to find <m>\bar{x}</m>  using a horizontal element, as shown in the right image below, but the computations are a bit more challenging. First the equation for <m>dA</m> changes to <me>dA = \underset{base}{x(y)}\ \underset{ height}{(dy)}</me></p>
<p/>
<p>Additionally, the distance to the centroid of each element, <m>\bar{x}_{el}</m> , must measure to the middle of the horizontal element. For this triangle, <me>\bar{x}_{el}=\frac{x(y)}{2}</me></p><image width="60%" source="images/dan-strips2.png"/>
<p/>
<p/>
<p>We find a similar contrast to finding the vertical centroidal distance <m>\bar{y}</m>  where it is easier to use a <m>dy</m> element to find <m>\bar{y}</m>  than it is to use a <m>dx</m> element. </p></assemblage></subsection><subsection xml:id="centroids-by-integration-examples">

<p>This solution demonstrates solving integrals using square elements and double integrals. Set the slider on the diagram to <m>dx\;dy</m> or <m>dy\;dx</m> to see a representative element.</p><paragraphs>

<title>Set up the integrals</title>


<p>As before, the triangle is bounded by the <m>x</m> axis, the vertical line <m>x = b</m>, and the line
<me>y = f(x) = \frac{h}{b} x \quad \text{or in terms of } y, \quad x = g(y) = \frac{b}{h} y</me>.</p>
<p>In this solution the integrals will be evaluated using square differential elements <m>dA=dy\; dx</m> located at <m>(x,y)</m>.</p>
<p>With double integration, you must take care to evaluate the limits correctly, since the limits on the inside integral are functions of the variable of integration of the outside integral.  The inside integral essentially stacks the elements into strips and the outside integral adds all the strips to cover the area.</p>
<p>Choosing to express <m>dA</m> as <m> dy\;dx</m> means that the integral over <m>y</m> will be conducted first.  The limits on the inside integral are from <m>y = 0</m> to <m>y = f(x)</m>.  Then, the limits on the outside integral are from <m>x = 0</m> to <m>x=b.</m></p>
<p>Using <m>dA= dx\;dy</m> would reverse the order of integration, so the inside integral’s limits would be from <m>x = g(y)</m> to <m>x = b</m>, and the limits on the outside integral would be <m>y=0</m> to <m>y = h</m>.  Either choice will give the same results <mdash/><em>if you don't make any errors!</em></p>
<p>The area of the square element is the base times the height, so <me> dA = dy\ dx</me>.  The centroid of the square is located at its midpoint so, by inspection

<title>Set up the integrals</title>


<p>Determining the bounding functions and setting up the integrals is usually the most difficult part of problems like this. Begin by drawing and labeling a sketch of the situation. </p>
<p><ol>
<li>Place a point in the first quadrant and label it <m>P=(a,b)</m>. This point is in the first quadrant and fixed since we are told that <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are positive integers</li>
<li>Place a horizontal line through <m>P</m> to make the upper bound.</li>
<li>Sketch in a parabola with a vertex at the origin and passing through <m>P</m> and shade in the enclosed area.</li>
<li>Decide which differential element you intend to use. For this example we choose to use vertical strips, which you can see if you tick  <c>show strips</c> in the interactive above.  Horizontal strips <m>dA = x\ dy</m> would give the same result, but you would need to define the equation for the parabola in terms of <m>y</m>. </li></ol></p>
<p>Determining the equation of the parabola and expressing it in terms of of <m>x</m> and any known constants is a critical step.  You should remember from algebra that the general equation of parabola with a vertex at the origin is <m>y = k x^2</m>, where <m>k</m> is a constant which determines the shape of the parabola.  If <m>k \gt 0</m>, the parabola opens upward and if <m>k \lt 0</m>, the parabola opens downward.</p>
<p>To find the value of <m>k</m>, substitute the coordinates of <m>P</m> into the general equation, then solve for <m>k</m>. <md><mrow>y \amp = k x^2, \text{ so at } P </mrow><mrow>(b) \amp = k (a)^2</mrow><mrow>k \amp= \frac{b}{a^2}</mrow></md></p>
<p>The resulting function of the parabola is <me> y = y(x) = \frac{b}{a^2} x^2</me>.  </p>
<p>To perform the integrations, express the area and centroidal coordinates of the element in terms of the points at the top and bottom of the strip.  The area of the strip is its height times its base, so <me>dA = (b-y)\ dx</me>.  If you incorrectly used <m>dA =  y\ dx</m>, you would find the centroid of the spandrel below the curve.</p>
<p>For vertical strips, the bottom is at <m>(x,y)</m> on the parabola, and the top is directly above at <m>(x,b)</m>.  The strip has a differential width <m>dx</m>. The centroid of the strip is located at its midpoint and the coordinates are are found by averaging the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> coordinates of the points at the top and bottom.
<md><mrow>\bar{x}_{el} \amp =  (x + x)/2 = x</mrow><mrow>\bar{y}_{el} \amp =  (y+b)/2</mrow></md></p>
<p>For vertical strips, the integrations are with respect to <m>x</m>, and the limits on the integrals are <m>x=0</m> on the left to <m>x = a</m> on the right.</p></paragraphs><paragraphs>

<title>Solve the integrals</title>


<p>We have already established that <m>y(x) = k x^2</m> where <m>k = b/a^2</m>.  To simplify the algebra, it is best not to prematurely substitute y(x) and <m>k</m>, but you must substitute in any functions of <m>x</m> before you do the integration step. </p>

<p>The area of a semicircle is well known, so there is no need to actually evaluate <m>A = \int dA</m>, <me>A = \int dA = \frac{\pi r^2}{2}</me>.</p>
<p>Since the semi-circle is symmetrical about the <m>y</m> axis, <me>Q_y = \int \bar{x}_{el}\; dA= 0</me>. This is because each element of area to the right of the <m>y</m> axis is balanced by a corresponding element the same distance the left which cancel each other out in the sum.</p>
<p>All that remains is to evaluate the integral <m>Q_x</m> in the numerator of 
<me>\bar{y} = \frac{Q_x}{A} = \frac{\bar{y}_{el}\; dA}{A}</me></p>
<p>The differential area <m>dA</m> is the product of two differential quantities, we will need to perform a double integration.

<p><term>Distributed loads</term> are forces which are spread out over a length, area, or volume. Most real-world forces are distributed loads, including the weight of building materials and the force of wind, water, or earth pushing on a surface.  Pressure, load, weight density and stress are all names commonly used for distributed loads.</p>
<p>We can use the computational tools discussed in the previous chapters to distributed loads if we first convert them to equivalent point forces. This equivalent replacement must be the <term>resultant</term> of the distributed loading, as discussed in <xref ref="resultant"/>.  Recall that this resultant force has the identical effect on the object as the original system of forces had. </p>
<p>To be equivalent, the point force must have a:
<ul label="square">
<li>Magnitude equal to the the area or volume under the distributed load function.</li>
<li>Line of action that passes through the centroid of the distributed load distribution.</li></ul></p>
<p>The next two sections will explore how to find the magnitude and location of the equivalent point force for a distributed load.</p></introduction><subsection xml:id="Chapter_07-distributed-loads-equivalent-magnitude">

<p>To this point in Statics, we have considered that each body would have its own weight acting as a point load, as shown in the figure below.</p><figure>

<p>Each unit of length of the shelf is experiencing the distributed load as a weight per length.

<p>The total weight of books is equal to the sum of the weight of each individual book. Similarly, the total weight of the books is equal to the intensity of the distributed load times the length of the shelf or

<title>Equivalent Location</title>


<p>To use a distributed load in an equilibrium problem, you must know the equivalent magnitude to sum the forces, and also know the position or line of action to sum the moments.  </p>
<p>Revisiting the book example <xref ref="bookshelf-example"/>, from life experience you know that the equivalent point force acts through the center of the row of books. This is because the equivalent point force acts through the centroid of area under the load intensity curve and the centroid of a rectangular shape is in the center.  We know the vertical and horizontal coordinates of this centroid, but since the equivalent point force’s line of action is vertical and we can slide a force along its line of action, the vertical coordinate of the centroid not important in this context.</p>
<p>Similarly, for a triangular distributed load <mdash/> also called a uniformly varying load <mdash/> the magnitude of the equivalent force is the area of the triangle, <m>bh/2</m> and the line of action passes through the centroid of the triangle. The horizontal distance from the larger end of the triangle to the centroid is <m>\bar{x} = b/3</m>.</p>
<p>Essentially, we're finding the balance point so that the force to the left of the centroid is the same as the force to the right. Therefore we can state that:</p>
<p>The examples below will illustrate how you can combine the computation of both the magnitude and location of the equivalent point force for a series of distributed loads.</p><investigation xml:id="Chapter_07-distributed-loads-equivalent-location-linearly-varying-load">

<li>What is the basic relationship between depth and pressure?</li>
<li>How are absolute and relative pressure different? </li>
<li>How can use use our knowledge of centroids to compute the equivalent point forces of fluids?</li></ul></objectives><introduction>
<p>Pressure is a force distributed over an area.  When you dive underwater, you may have noticed that the pressure you feel in your ears increases with depth.  This same pressure applies a distributed load on to surfaces submerged in a fluid, like the face of a dam or a gate used to control irrigation flows.</p>
<p>There are two types of pressure we can measure. 
<ul label="square">
<li><term>Absolute pressure</term> which includes the surface air pressure plus the water pressure.  It is called absolute pressure because it is the pressure measured above an absolute or perfect vacuum.</li>
<li><term>Gage pressure</term> which only includes the water pressure and ignores the air pressure which is relatively consistent.  It is called gage pressure because it is the pressure you measure with a pressure gage, which normally reads zero when it is exposed to the atmosphere.  In effect, pressure gages ignore the pressure of the atmosphere which surrounds us.</li></ul></p>
<p>We will refer to gage pressure for the remainder of the chapter so that the top surface pressure will always be zero.</p>
<p>Imagine you have a pool which is <m>h</m> meters deep. At the top of the water, the gage pressure is zero no matter which unit system you use. As you descend to the bottom of the pool, the fluid pressure <m>P</m> increases with depth according to the equation <m>P = \rho g h</m>, where:
<ul label="square">
<li><m>\rho</m> is the density of a fluid,</li>
<li><m>g</m> is gravitational acceleration, and </li>
<li><m>h</m> is the height of fluid above the point of interest.</li></ul></p>
<p>Notice that pressure increases linearly with depth. The pressure 3 meters below the surface is three times the pressure 1 meter below the surface. </p>
<p>Pressure is a force per area with units typically expressed as:
<ul label="square">
<li>1 pascals (Pa) = 1 <m>\text{N}/\text{m}^2</m></li>
<li>1 kilopascal (kPa) = 1000 <m>\text{N}/\text{m}^2</m></li>
<li>1 pound per square inch (psi) = <m>\text{lb}/\text{in}^2</m></li>
<li>1 kip per square inch (kpsi) = 1000 <m>\text{lb}/\text{in}^2</m></li>

<p>Since fluid pressure increases linearly with depth, it behaves as a distributed load which increases linearly from 0 at the surface to <m>\rho g h</m> at depth <m>h</m>. This can be replaced with an equivalent point force acting through the centroid of the triangle loading, with a magnitude equal to the triangular area.</p><figure xml:id="pressure-on-dam">

<p>In the remainder of this section, we will consider the effect of fluid pressure on underwater surfaces, including slanted or curved objects. In all cases, we will simply ask that question: what is the pressure at each point and how does it change along our object?</p>
<p>This section will allow you to see how to apply fluid pressure to Statics problems. First it is valuable to discuss a few more details.
<ol>
<li>
<p>The pressure due to the fluid always acts normal the surface.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Fluid pressure is the same in all directions. Therefore: 
    <ol>
<li>
<p>A point underwater will feel the same pressure from every direction.</p></li>
<li>
<p>The upper left corner of the block will have the same pressure pushing down as it does to the right. </p><image width="50%" source="images/pressure-distribution.jpg"/></li></ol></p></li>
<li>
<p>Fluid pressure <m>P = \rho g h</m> is valid only for incompressible fluids like water or oil, but not for compressible fluids like air.
    <ol>
<li>
<p>If you throw a water balloon at your brother's head, it breaks rather than compressing the water. If you throw an air-filled balloon at your brother's head, the air compresses and it bounces off.</p></li></ol></p></li>
<li>
<p>In English units, specific weight <m>\gamma</m> is often used instead of density <m>\rho</m> to describe fluids.  Specific weight is the <em>weight</em> per unit volume of a substance, while density is its <em>mass</em> per unit volume.  The two properties are related by <me> \gamma = \rho g</me>.  The specific weight of freshwater at room temperature is about <m>\pqf{62.4}</m>.</p></li>
<li>
<p>This book always uses gage pressure, which is the pressure above the surrounding atmospheric pressure. The surrounding atmosphere exerts approximately <m>\psinch{14.7}</m> or <m>\Nsm{101.3 \times 10^3} = 101.3~\text{kPa}</m> on everything on the surface of the earth.
    <ol>
<li>
<p>Imagine that we went three feet down in the water. Then the pressure would have increased by <m>\pqf{62.4} \times \ft{3} = \psf{187}</m>  which is <m>\psinch{1.3}</m> or 9% more than atmospheric pressure.</p></li>
<li>
<p>If, on the other hand, you went 30 feet down in the water, the pressure would have increased 10 times this much to  <m>\psinch{13}</m> which is about 200% of atmospheric pressure.</p></li></ol></p></li></ol></p>

<p>Is fluid pressure the surface area of the container?  For instance, is the pressure below the Atlantic Ocean less than the pressure below the Pacific Ocean since the Pacific is larger?</p></statement><answer>
<p>No.  Fluid pressure is a function of density and depth only, so the surface area of an ocean or tank is insignificant. <me> P = \rho g h</me>. Assuming that the density of seawater and <m>g</m> are the same everywhere under the ocean, the gage pressure depends on depth only.</p></answer></question></subsection><subsection xml:id="Chapter_07-fluid-statics-fluid-statics-applications">

<p>You must include the distances <m>\m{0.3}</m>  and <m>\m{0.3}</m>  at the top to locate the weight of the horizontal piece. Units are not shown here for clarity, but must appear on your FBD.</p>
<p>The easiest way to solve this is to apply the principle of transmissibility: slide the lower trapezoid left until it aligns with the upper triangle and makes a triangular loading. </p>
<p>The total horizontal force from the water will be 
<md><mrow>F_x \amp =  P_{ave}\ A</mrow><mrow>\amp =  \left[\frac{1}{2} \rho\ g\ \m{0.75}\right](\m{0.75} \times \m{1})</mrow></md> acting to the right <m>\m{0.25}</m> above point  <m>A</m>.</p>
<p>The total vertical load from the water is
<md><mrow>F_y \amp  =   P_{ave}\ A</mrow><mrow>\amp =  [\rho\ g\ (\m{0.15})] (\m{0.6} \times \m{1})</mrow></md>acting upward  <m>\m{0.3}</m> to the left of <m>A</m>.</p>
<p>From here this is just solving the equilibrium problem which you should complete for practice.</p></solution></investigation></subsection></section><exercises><exercise><interactive xml:id="exam-66636-17" platform="numbas" preview="numbas"><slate surface="numbas" source="numbas/exam-66636-17-centroids-by-integration" width="100%" height="500px"/></interactive></exercise><exercise><interactive xml:id="exam-66619-16" platform="numbas" preview="numbas"><slate surface="numbas" source="numbas/exam-66619-centroids-by-composite-area" width="100%" height="500px"/></interactive></exercise></exercises></chapter>
