  <title>Rigid Body Equilibrium</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>In this chapter we will investigate the equilibrium of simple rigid bodies like your book, phone, or pencil. The important difference between rigid bodies and particles is that rigid bodies have the potential to rotate around a point or axis, while particles do not.</p>
    <p>For rigid body equilibrium, we need to maintain translational equilibrium with <m>\Sigma \vec{F}=0</m> and also maintain a balance of rotational forces and couple moments with a new equilibrium equation:  <m>\Sigma \vec{M}=0</m>.</p>

    <p>Free body diagrams are the tool that engineers use to identify the forces and moments that influence an object.  They will be used extensively in statics, and you will use them again in other engineering courses: Dynamics, Kinematics, Strength of Materials, and Fluid Mechanics, so your effort to master them now is worthwhile. Although the concept is simple, students often have great difficulty with them.</p>
    <p>Their importance can’t be overstated. They are the basis for writing all equilibrium equations; if your free-body diagram is incorrect your equations, analysis, and solutions will be wrong as well.</p>
    <p>
      <em>You are required to draw and label a free-body diagram for every equilibrium problem</em>

      <title>Creating Free Body Diagrams</title>
      <p>Drawing correct free-body diagrams is the single most important step for solving equilibrium problems. You are encouraged to find a repeatable process for creating them.  We suggest following these five steps.
<ol><li><title>Isolate</title><p>The <q>free-body</q> in free-body diagram means that the body to be analyzed must be free from the supports that are physically holding it in place. Sketch an outline of the object as if it is floating in space. To reiterate, do <em>not</em> draw free-body diagram forces on top of your problem drawing <mdash/> the body needs to be drawn free of its support for a free-body diagram to be created.</p></li><li><title>Axis</title><p>Establish a right-hand coordinate system to use as a reference for your equilibrium equations. Any right-hand system works, but look ahead and select one which minimizes the number of unknown force components in your equations. The choice is technically arbitrary, but a good reference system should help you solve the problem. If you and another student pick different reference systems, you should both get the same answer, while expressing your work with different components.</p></li><li><title>Loads</title><p> Add vectors representing the applied forces and couple moments acting on the body.  Include the body’s weight if it is available. Every vector should have a descriptive variable name and a clear arrowhead indicating its direction.   If a vector’s direction is unknown, you must assume one.</p></li><li><title>Reactions</title><p>Traverse the perimeter of the object and replace the supports removed by isolating the body with equivalent forces and couple moments (collectively <em>reactions</em>) provided to the body. There are two ways to find the reactions from supports:
<ol><li>Supports provide the type (force or moment) and direction of support a body needs to resist applied loads</li><li>Each support type provides a limited set of possible reactions as shown in <xref ref="reactions_table"/>.</li></ol>
                  </p><p>Interpreting the correct reaction forces and couple moments coming from supports is perhaps the most challenging step in the entire equilibrium process. Label each reaction with a descriptive variable name and a clear arrowhead.   Again, if a vector’s direction is unknown just assume one. </p></li><li><title>Dimensions</title><p>Give all pertinent dimensions and angles on the free-body diagram, but don't clutter it up with unneeded information;  supply only the dimensions and angles you need for your calculations.   This diagram should be a “stand-alone” presentation.</p></li></ol>
         </p>
      <p>Drawing good free-body diagrams is surprisingly tricky and requires practice.  Study the examples, think hard about them, do lots of problems, and learn from your errors.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Two-dimensional Reactions</title>
      <p>Supports supply reaction forces and moment which prevent bodies from moving when loaded. In the most basic terms, forces prevent translation, and moments prevent rotation. As you learned in Chapter 4, there are two types of moments, couple-moments and <m>\vec{r} \times \vec{F}</m> moments both of which can prevent rotation.</p>
      <p>The reactions a support supplies depends on the nature of the particular support. For example, a door hinge allows the door to rotate freely but prevents it from moving left, right, up, or down. We model a hinge as having horizontal and vertical reaction forces, but no reaction moment around the pin. We can evaluate all the other physical supports in a similar way to come up with the table below. You will notice that some two-dimensional supports only restrain one degree of freedom and others restrain up to three degrees of freedom. The number of degrees of freedom directly correlates to the number of unknowns created by the support. </p>
      <p>The table below shows typical two-dimensional support methods and the corresponding reaction forces and moments supplied each.</p>

      <title>Three-dimensional Reactions</title>
      <p>The main added complexity with three-dimensional objects is that there are more possible ways the the object can move, and also more possible ways to restrain it. The table below show the types of supports which are available and the corresponding reaction forces and moment.  As before, your free-body digrams should show the reactions supplied by the constraints, not the constraints themselves.</p>

    <title>Degree of Freedom</title>
    <p><em>Degrees of freedom</em> refers to the number of independent parameters or values required to specify the <em>state</em> of an object, where state for a rigid body refers to its position and orientation in space. </p>
    <p>As shown in the figure below, for an object existing in the <m>xy</m> plane, any translational movement can be represented by changes in the  <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> coordinates and changes in orientation by angle \theta_z. Therefore, the complete movement of the body can be defined by two translations and one rotation <mdash/> hence, three degrees of freedom for an object in two-dimensional space.</p>

    <p>Later in this chapter, we will revisit three-dimensional rigid bodies that can translate in and rotate around all three orthogonal directions. Therefore as shown in <xref ref="FBD_ex1FBD2"/>, translation can be represented by the distances of <m>\Delta x</m>, <m>\Delta y</m> and <m>\Delta z</m>. Rotation of the body can occur around all three axes represented by the angular distances <m>\theta_x</m>, <m>\theta_y</m> and <m>\theta_z</m>. The complete movement of the body can be defined by three translations and three rotations <mdash/> hence, six degrees of freedom from an object in three-dimensional space. Three-dimensional equilibrium of simple structures is found in section.</p>

    <p>For a body to be in static equilibrium, all possible movements of the body need to be adequately restrained. If a degree of freedom is not restrained, the body is in an unstable state and is not <q>static.</q> Stability is highly desirable for reasons of human safety, and bodies are often restrained by <em>lots</em> of restraints so that if one were to fail, the body would still be stable. If the restraints correctly interpreted, then equal constraints and degrees of freedom create a stable system. If the number of restraints exceeds the number of degrees of freedom, the body is in equilibrium, but you will need more equations than we cover in statics determine their values.</p>

      <title>Two-dimensional Free Body Diagram Examples</title>
      <p>Given that there a handful of options for representing the reaction forces and couple-moments from each support, it turns out there are often a few different equally valid options for drawing free-body diagrams. <xref ref="FBD_Examples_2D"/> demonstrates this flexibility for each of the problem drawings at the top of each column.</p>

      <p>On the fixed-support problem drawing on the left side of the figure, notice how the wall at <m>A</m>  prevents the beam from translating up or down, translating left or right, or rotating in the plane of the page. As all three of the two-dimensional motion degrees of freedom are restrained, the beam does not need any additional supports. Conveniently the three unknown reactions also matches the three independent equations of equilibrium which will be discussed later in this chapter. </p>
      <p>On the pin and roller problem drawing on the right side of the figure, the pin at <m>A</m> prevents translation in all directions but allows free rotation. The roller at <m>B</m> prevents translation in the direction perpendicular to the ground only.</p>

    <p>Now that you have thoroughly learned how to draw accurate free-body diagrams, it is time to bring in some equations so that we can solve problems. Recall that Newton’s 2nd law tells us that Newton’s second law states that a particle accelerates in the direction of and at a rate proportional to the net applied force. For translational motion, Newton’s 2nd law can be represented by the equation: </p>
    <p>
      <men>\Sigma\vec{F}=m\vec{a}\text{, where: }</men>
    </p>
    <p>
      <md>
        <mrow> \Sigma \vec{F} \amp\equiv\text{sum of forces on the body}</mrow>
        <mrow>m\amp\equiv \text{mass of the body}</mrow>
        <mrow> \vec{a} \amp\equiv \text{linear acceleration of the body}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>Rotational motion has a parallel equation which is</p>
    <p>
      <men>\Sigma\vec{M}_o=I_o \boldsymbol{\alpha}\text{, where: }</men>
    </p>
    <p>
      <md>
        <mrow>\Sigma \vec{M}_o  \amp\equiv \text{sum of moments around point }o</mrow>
        <mrow> I_o \amp\equiv \text{mass moment of inertia about point }o</mrow>
        <mrow>\boldsymbol{\alpha} \amp\equiv \text{angular acceleration of the body}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>In statics, we focus on systems which are not accelerating, thus both the linear acceleration <m>\vec{a}</m> and angular acceleration <m>\vec{\alpha}</m> must equal zero. As described in <xref ref="Chapter_03"/>, this means that the linear velocity must either be constant or zero. The same argument holds for the angular velocity. Thus we are left with the simplified equations: </p>
    <p>
      <men>\Sigma\vec{F}=0 \text{ in }\textbf{all}\text{ directions}</men>
    </p>
    <p>
      <men xml:id="sigmaM">\Sigma\vec{M}=0 \text{ about }\textbf{all} \text{ axes of rotation}</men>
    </p>
    <p>Let us examine how we can put this knowledge to use in a two-dimensional problem. For the <m>\Sigma\vec{F}=0</m> equation, there are infinite directions in the <m>xy</m> plane of a two-dimensional problem, so it is best to be strategic on which directions you select. You should recall from Chapter 2 the reason we use the <m>xy</m> orthogonal coordinate system is that the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> axes are independent of each other because they are perpendicular. Thus, picking any two orthogonal directions to solve the equation <m>\Sigma\vec{F}=0</m> gives us independent equations to solve for two of the unknowns, which also takes care of two of the degrees of freedom. We are then left with the final rotation degree of freedom. Setting the sum of moments about any of the infinite points in the <m>xy</m> plane equal to zero ensures no rotational motion is allowed. Often we sum moments around a point on the body, but the equation <m>\Sigma\vec{M}_o=0</m> works equally as well for points off the body.</p>
    <p>Recognize that equations of equilibrium are the mathematical representation of a free-body diagram. Hence, drawing an incorrect free-body diagram will cause you to write the wrong equations of equilibrium and not be able to solve the problem correctly!</p>
  </section>
  <section xml:id="Chapter_05-solution-strategies">
    <title>Solution Strategies</title>
    <p>There are many sets of independent equations which you are able to use to solve two-dimensional equilibrium problems. The most typical set of equations used are:<md><mrow>\Sigma\vec{F}_x\amp=0 \amp \Sigma\vec{F}_y\amp=0 \amp \Sigma\vec{M}_o\amp=0</mrow></md>
      </p>
    <p>If you choose this typical set of equations, you have two decisions to make to help decrease the amount of math you need to solve for the unknowns. First, choose an axis system. To decrease the number of terms in the <m>\Sigma \vec{F}_x</m> and <m>\Sigma \vec{F}_y</m> equations, pick an axis system that lines up with as many unknown force vectors as possible. Second, you can sum moments around any point on or off the body, so try to select:
<ul label="square"><li>a point at the intersection of as many force lines-of-action as possible, and</li><li>a point which minimizes the number of unknowns in your moment equation.</li></ul>
      </p>
    <p>Sometimes the two factors will optimize the same point. Other times, there are compromises to make. Do not sweat these two decisions too hard in the beginning; the selection of any axis and any point to sum moments around will give you the same answer.</p>
    <p>The typical choice of equations stated above are certainly not the only set of equations that can be used. Any force equations can be replaced with a linearly independent moment equation, so the other possibilities are:
<ol><li>The typical choice, two equations summing forces in perpendicular directions and one moment equation. <md><mrow> \Sigma\vec{F}_x\amp=0 \amp\Sigma\vec{F}_y\amp=0 \amp\Sigma\vec{M}_o\amp=0\text{, or} </mrow></md>
            </li><li>two moment equations and force equation.  This choice is used for equilibrium involving parallel forces. <md><mrow> \Sigma\vec{F}_x\amp=0 \amp\Sigma\vec{M}_A\amp=0 \amp\Sigma\vec{M}_B\amp=0\text{, or} </mrow></md>
            </li><li>three moment equations, such as <md><mrow> \Sigma\vec{M}_A\amp=0 \amp\Sigma\vec{M}_B\amp=0 \amp\Sigma\vec{M}_C\amp=0</mrow></md>.  The three points chosen must not be collinear, <ie/> they must not all lie on the same straight line.</li></ol>
      </p>
    <p>While following one of the three rules above does guarantee the <em>independence</em> of your equations, you have further freedom to choose equations that help you to find efficient solutions. Efficiency, in this case, is defined as the desire to avoid simultaneous equations when possible. This efficiency is based on the fact that equations with only a single unknown are faster to solve than multiple-unknown equations that require substitution, linear algebra, or other solution techniques. The four choices which contribute to setting up efficient equations are the selection of 1) equilibrium equations, 2) the axis, 3) the points you sum moments around, and finally, 4) the <em>order</em> in which you solve the equations.</p>

    <p>Some equations of equilibrium are simpler to solve than others. If an equation yields only a single unknown, it is a good starting point as multiple-unknown / multiple-equations sets can take more effort to solve, especially under the stress of a quiz or exam. The equations below are all valid equilibrium equations that could serve as a starting point for your computations.
<md><mrow>\Sigma \vec{F}_x \amp= 0 \amp \Sigma \vec{M}_A \amp= 0</mrow><mrow>\Sigma \vec{M}_B \amp= 0 \amp \Sigma \vec{F}_y \amp= 0</mrow><mrow>\nearrow_+ \Sigma \vec{F}_{45^{\circ}}\amp= 0 \amp \Sigma \vec{M}_{any}\amp= 0</mrow></md>
      </p>
    <p>Note that we have written six equations to show the breadth of possibilities, but when you solve two-dimensional equilibrium problems, you are limited to three independent equations. Selecting more equations does not give you more information, it only confirms what you already knew, like <m>0 = 0</m> or <m>A_x = A_x</m>. Once you have selected your three equations, the free-body diagram is now represented in equation form to enable you to solve for unknowns present on the free-body diagram.</p>
    <p>The signs (<m>\pm</m>) of all known and unknown terms in your equations of equilibrium come from the axis system you draw as part of your free-body diagram. The only exception to this rule in the set above is the equation <m>\nearrow_+ \vec{F}_{\ang{45}}= 0</m> which is essentially defining an additional axis at <m>\ang{45}</m> above horizontal.</p>
    <p>The steps below walk through the second of the three options for independent equation sets: three moment equations not involving three co-linear points. This option turns out to be an efficient solution pathway for this system. Step 1 will sum moments around point <m>B</m>, yielding a single unknown <mdash/>
         <m>F_3</m>. Step 2 sums moments around point C to solve for <m>F_2</m>. Step 3 sums moments around point A to solve for <m>F_1</m>. Finally, Step 4 (optional) draws the free-body diagram with all forces presented in the correct direction.</p>

If you choose another equation that has not already been used, you will end up checking our solutions. In the case of <m>\Sigma \vec{F}_x=0</m> we would find that <m>\lb{100}-\lb{50}-\lb{50}=0</m> which confirms that our solutions are accurate.</p>
    <p>As a reflection, the equations below show several different starting strategies for solving this problem.</p>

      <title/>
      <p>Many equilibrium problems <em>cannot</em> be solved by the methods we are now learning, and it is fruitless to try. This section will help you learn how to separate the solvable problems from the unsolvable ones<fn>Rest assured that all homework and exam problems will be solvable, however.</fn>.</p>
      <p>A body in equilibrium is held stable by supports that both counteract the applied loads and also restrict the body’s motion. The number and orientation of the support components determine if a rigid body is <em>stable</em> or <em>unstable</em>. You have also learned to represent supports with reaction forces and couple-moments on a free-body diagram and to create equations from a free-body diagram to solve for the unknown terms. Having enough information in these equations to mathematically solve a statics problem determines if the problem is either <em>determinate</em> or <em>indeterminate</em>. All problems in statics need to be determinate and stable. In subsequent courses, you will learn additional tools/equations to evaluate more complicated systems. The next two sections drill down into these terms a bit deeper.</p>
    </paragraphs>
    <paragraphs>
      <title>Stable vs. Unstable</title>
      <p>When the support components are sufficient to restrain a body from moving, we say that the body is <em>stable</em>. The stability of a two-dimensional body is ensured when the body is prevented from 1) translating in the plane of the page and 2) rotating around an axis perpendicular to the page. If the supports do not allow a body to move, we call it stable. Stability is loading independent <ie/> the stability of a body is not related to the applied loads. Equilibrium must be maintained for <em>any</em> loading condition.</p>
    </paragraphs>
    <paragraphs>
      <title>Determinate vs Indeterminate</title>
      <p>A static system is <em>determinate</em> if the reactions can be found by the methods of statics, that is, by using equilibrium equations.</p>
      <p>In order for a system to be determinate, the number of reaction components must equal the degrees of freedom of the body. In terms of forces and moment equations, the number of unknowns (often reaction forces and moments) equals the number of independent equations of equilibrium. For two-dimensional systems, there are three degrees of freedom . Therefore we can determine no more than three unknown reaction components. </p>
      <p>An indeterminate system with fewer reaction components than degrees of freedom is <em>under-constrained</em> and therefore unstable. On the other hand, if there are more reaction components than degrees of freedom, the system is both <em>over-constrained</em> and <em>indeterminate</em>.<em/>In terms of force and moment equations, the there are more unknowns than  than equilibrium equations and so they can’t be determined.  This is not to say that it is impossible to find the reaction force on an over-constrained system, just that you will not be learning how to find them in this course.</p>

      <title>Rules to Validate a Stable and Determinate System</title>

      <title>Three-dimensional Equilibrium</title>
      <p>To start this section, it is valuable to recognize the similarities and differences between two-dimensional and three-dimensional equilibrium problems. The first similarity is that the general equilibrium equations are the same. <me>\Sigma\vec{F}=0 \text{ in }\textbf{all} \text{ directions}</me>
            <me>\Sigma\vec{M}_o=0 \text{ about }\textbf{all}\text{ axes of rotation}</me>

      <p>The general procedure of analysis is exactly the same, only differing in the number of equations to be solved.

      <title>Non-engaged Reaction Couples</title>
      <p>One new issue we have to face in three-dimensional problems is that some reaction couples are available but not engaged. Before we get into the details for reaction couples, let us discuss what we mean by the word <em>engaged</em>. Picture a crate sitting at rest on a horizontal surface. If you were to attach a cable to the top of the crate, but not pull on the cable, the tension in the cable would be available but not <em>engaged</em> in this condition. Instead, the floor’s normal force would be supporting the full weight of the crate without need of the tension force in the cable. If we were to remove the floor under the crate, then the cable’s tension force would be engaged to support the weight of the crate.</p>
      <figure xml:id="engaged">

      <p>Now lets refocus our discussion on reaction couples and talk through a quick experiment that you can do.
<ul label="square"><li>Find a rigid object around 1 to 3 feet long that you can pick up with one hand. An umbrella, baseball bat, or even a textbook would work.</li><li>Grip the object on one end with one hand. Describe the type of forces and couple-moments you feel in your hand. What would a free-body diagram of the object look like?</li><li>Now grip the object with two hands on either end of the object. How did the forces and couple-moments change from when you were holding with one hand?</li></ul>
         </p>
      <p>You should have discovered that the vertical force from each of your two hands was half of the vertical force required with one hand. But hopefully, you noticed something more than a change in force magnitude. When holding the object with one hand, did you feel that your hand needed to provide a resistance to the rotation of the object? When you grabbed the other side with your second hand, this resistance to rotation was no longer needed. The phenomena that you (hopefully) just discovered can be described by the saying <q>reaction forces engage before reaction couple-moments</q>. Essentially, the vertical force in your second hand engaged instead of the couple-moment resistance in your first hand. The reaction couple-moments from both hands are technically both available, but the vertical forces from the other hand engage first, as seen in the XREF Figure below.</p>

      <title>Strategies to Solve Three-dimensional Equilibrium Problems </title>
      <p>While three-dimensional systems are closer to reality than their two-dimensional cousins, they do require a bit more math to solve. The two reasons more math is required is:
<ul label="square"><li>The forces and moments require more effort to resolve into components.</li><li>There are more unknown terms and degrees of freedom for each body. Three-dimensional free-body diagrams have up to six as compared to only three for two-dimensional systems.</li></ul>
         </p>
    </paragraphs>
    <paragraphs>
      <title>Resolving Forces and Moments into Components</title>
      <p>To break two-dimensional forces into components, you likely used right-triangle trigonometry, sine and cosine. However, three-dimensional forces will likely need to be broken into components using XREF Ch 2 unit vectors.</p>
      <p>When summing moments, make sure to consider both the <m>\vec{r}\times\vec{F}</m> moments and also the couple-moments with the following guidance:
<ol><li><p>First, choose any point in the system to sum moments around.</p></li><li><p>There are two general methods for summing your <m>\vec{r}\times\vec{F}</m> moments. Both techniques will give you the same set of equations.
<ol><li><title>Sum moments around each axis</title><p>For relatively simple systems with few position and force vector components, you can find the cross product for each non-parallel position and force vector pair. Using this method requires you to resolve the direction of each cross product pair using the right-hand rule as XREF covered in Ch 4. Recall that there are up to six pairs of non-parallel components that you need to consider.</p></li><li><title>Sum all moments around a point using vector determinates</title><p>Choose a point in the system which is on the line of action of as many forces as possible, then set up each cross product as a determinant. After computing the components coming from each determinant, combine the <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m> terms into each of the <m>\Sigma\vec{M}_x=0</m>, <m>\Sigma\vec{M}_y=0</m>, and <m>\Sigma\vec{M}_z=0</m> equations.</p></li></ol>
                  </p></li><li><p>Finally, add the components of any couple moments into the corresponding <m>\Sigma\vec{M}_x=0</m>, <m>\Sigma\vec{M}_y=0</m>, and <m>\Sigma\vec{M}_z=0</m> equations.</p></li></ol>

      <title>Solving for unknown values in equilibrium equations</title>
      <p>Once you have your <m>\Sigma\vec{F}=0</m> and <m>\Sigma\vec{M}_o=0</m> equations in each of your <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m> directions set up, you could be facing up to six equations and six unknown values. Nearly all equation sets are solvable with substitution, but it can often be easier to solve these large equation sets with linear algebra. Note that the adjective “linear” specifies that your unknown values must be linear terms, which means that each unknown variable cannot be raised to a exponent, be an exponent, or buried inside of a <m>sine</m> or <m>cosine</m> function. Luckily, most unknowns in equilibrium are linear terms, except for unknown angles. If you are not familiar with the use of linear algebra matrices to simultaneously solve equations, search the internet for <em>Solving Systems of Equations Using Linear Algebra</em> and you will find plenty of resources.</p>
      <p>No matter how you choose to solve for the unknown values, any numeric values which come out to be negative reveal that your initial hypothesis of that vector’s direction was incorrect.</p>
