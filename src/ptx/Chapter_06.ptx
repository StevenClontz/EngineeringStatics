  <title>Equilibrium of Structures</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>In this chapter you will conduct static analysis of multi-body structures. Broadly defined, a structure is any set of interconnected rigid bodies designed to serve a purpose.   The parts of the structure may move relative to one another, like the blades of scissors, or they may be fixed relative to one another, like the structural members of bridge. </p>
    <p>Analysis of structures involves determining all forces acting on and between individual members of the structure.  Fundamentally there is nothing new here; the techniques you have already learned apply, however structures tend to have more unknown forces, and so are more involved and provide more opportunities for error than the problems you have previously encountered.  Correct free-body diagrams and careful work are required, as always.</p>
  </introduction>
  <section xml:id="Chapter_06-structures">
    <title>Structures</title>
    <p>Structures fall into three broad categories: trusses, frames, and machines, and you should be able to identify which is which. </p>
    <p>A <term>truss</term> is a multi-body structure made up of long slender members connected at their ends in triangular subunits.  Truss members carry axial forces only.  Trusses are commonly used for spanning large distances without interruption: bridges, roof systems, stadiums, aircraft hangers, auditoriums for example.  They are also used for crane booms, radio towers and the like. Trusses are lightweight and relatively strong.  Over the years many unique truss designs have been developed and are often named after the original designer.</p>
    <p>A <term>frame</term> is a multi-part, rigid, stationary structure primarily designed to support some type of load.  A frame contains at least one multi-force member, which a truss never has. This means that, unlike trusses, frame members must support bending moments as well shear and normal forces.  Many common items can be considered frames.  Some examples: building structure, bike frames, ladders, scaffolding, and more.</p>
    <p>A <term>machine</term> is very similar to a frame, except that it includes some moving parts.  The purpose of a machine is usually to provide a mechanical advantage and multiply forces.  Pliers, scissors jacks, automobile suspensions, construction equipment are all examples of machines.</p>

    <p><term>Solving</term> a structure means determining all forces acting on all of its parts.  The solution typically begins by determining the global equilibrium of the entire structure, then breaking it into parts and analyzing each separate part.  The specific process will depend on the type of structure, but will always follow the principles covered in the previous chapters.</p>
    <paragraphs>
      <title>Two-force Members</title>
      <p>Many structures contain at least one two-force member, and trusses consist of two-force members exclusively.  Recall from <xref ref="two-force-bodies"/> that a two-force body is an object subjected to exactly two forces. Two-force members are not required to be slender or straight, but can be recognized because they connect to other bodies or supports at exactly two points, and have no other loading unless it is also applied at those points.</p>
      <p>Identifying two-force members is helpful when solving structures because they automatically establish the line of action of the two forces. In order for a two-force body to be in equilibrium, the forces acting on it must be equal in magnitude,  opposite in direction, and have a line-of-action passing through the point where the two forces are applied.  Since these points are known, the direction of the line-of-action is readily found.</p>
      <p>The common way to express the force of a two-force member is with a magnitude and a sense, where the sense is either tension or compression.  If the two forces tend to stretch the object we say it is in <em>tension</em>; if they act the other way and squash the object, it is in <em>compression</em>.  The usual approach is to assume that a two-force member is in tension, then draw the free-body diagram and write the equilibrium equations accordingly.  If the analysis shows that the forces are negative then they actually act with the opposite sense, <ie/> compression.</p>

  <section xml:id="Chapter_06-interactions-between-members">
    <title>Interactions between members</title>
    <p>When analyzing structures we are dealing with multi-body systems, and need to recall <xref ref="newtons-third-law" text="title"/>, <q>For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.</q>
      </p>
    <p>This law applies to multi-body systems wherever one body connects to another.  At any interaction point, forces are transferred from one body to the interacting body as equal and opposite action-reaction pairs.  These forces cancel out and are invisible when the structure is intact.  Only when we cut through a member or joint in the isolation step of creating a free-body diagram, do we expose the interaction forces. When drawing free-body diagrams of the components of structures, it is critically important to represent these action-reaction pairs consistently.  You may assume either direction for one, but the other <em>must</em> be equal and opposite.</p>
    <p>For example, look at the members and joints in the  truss below.  Diagram (a) shows the truss members held together by pins at <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m>.  The forces holding the parts together cancel and are not shown.  In the <sq>exploded</sq> view (b), the parts have been separated and the action-reaction pairs are exposed.  Member <m>AB</m> is in tension, and the forces acting on it, also called <m>AB</m>, oppose each other and tend to stretch the member. These stretching forces are accompanied by equal and opposite forces, also called <m>AB</m> acting on pins <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>. Tensile forces <m>BC</m> and compressive forces <m>CA</m> behave similarly.</p>

      <title>Equilibrium of Multi-Body Systems</title>
      <p>When a multipart structure is in equilibrium, each part of the structure is also in equilibrium.  For example in the truss below, each member of the truss, each joint, and each portion of the truss is also in equilibrium. This continues all the way down to the atoms of the structure. This universal equilibrium across spatial scales is one of the governing principles which allows us to break multi-body systems into smaller solvable parts. </p>

      <title>Load Paths</title>
      <p>Load paths can help you think about structural systems. Load paths show how applied forces like the floor load in the image below pass through the interconnected members of the structure until they end up at the fixed support reactions. All structural systems, whether non-moving frames or moving machines have some sort of load path. When analyzing all structures, you computationally move from known values through the interconnected bodies of the system, following the load path, solving for unknowns as you go.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>A <term>truss</term> is a rigid engineering structure made up of long, slender members connected at their ends.   Trusses are commonly used to span large distances with a strong, lightweight structure.  Some familiar applications of trusses are bridges, roof structures, and pilons. <term>Planar trusses</term> are two-dimension trusses built out of triangular subunits, while   <term>space trusses</term> are three-dimensional, and the basic unit is a tetrahedron.  </p>
      <p>In this section we will analyze a simplified approximation of a planar truss, called a <term>simple truss</term> and determine the forces the members individually support when the truss supports a load.   Two different approaches will be presented: the <term>method of sections</term>, and the <term>method of joints</term>.</p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection xml:id="simple-trusses">
      <title>Simple Trusses</title>
      <p>Truss members are connected to each other rigidly, by welding or joining the ends with a gusset plate.  This makes the connecting joints rigid, but also make the truss difficult to analyze.  To reduce the mathematical complexity in this text we will only consider <term>simple trusses</term>, which are a simplification appropriate for preliminary analysis.</p>

      <p>Simple trusses are made of all two-force members and all joints are modeled as frictionless pins. All applied and reaction forces are applied only to these joints. Simple trusses, by their nature, are statically determinate, having a sufficient number of equations to solve for all unknowns values. While the members of real-life trusses stretch and compress under load, we will continue to assume that all bodies we encounter are rigid.</p>
      <p>Simple trusses are made of triangles, which makes them rigid when removed from supports. Simple trusses are determinate, having a balance of equations and unknowns, following the equation: <me>\underbrace{2\times (\text{number of joints})}_{\text{system equations}} = \underbrace{(\text{number of reaction forces}) + (\text{number of members})}_{\text{system unknowns}}</me>
         </p>
      <p/>
      <p>Commonly, rigid trusses have only three reaction forces, resulting in the equation: <me>2\times (\text{number of joints})=3 + (\text{number of members})</me>
         </p>
      <p>Unstable trusses lack the structural members to maintain their rigidity when removed from their supports. They can also be recognized using the equation above having more system equations on the left side of the equation above then system unknowns on the right.</p>
      <p>Truss systems with redundant members have fewer system equations on the left side of the equation above than the system unknowns on the right. While they are indeterminate in statics, in later courses you will learn to solve these trusses too, by taking into account the deformations of the truss members.</p>
      <insight>
        <title>The Danger of Simple Trusses</title>
        <p>Simple trusses have no structural redundancy, which makes them easy to solve using the techniques of this chapter, however this simplicity also has a dark side.  </p>

        <p>These trusses are sometimes called  <em>fracture critical trusses</em> because the failure of a single component can lead to catastrophic failure of the entire structure.  With no redundancy, there is no alternative load path for the forces that normally would be supported by that member. You can visualize the fracture critical nature of simple trusses by thinking about a triangle with pinned corners. If one side of a triangle fails, the other two sides lose their support and will collapse. In a full truss made of only triangles, the collapse of one triangle starts a chain reaction which causes others to collapse as well. </p>
        <p>While fracture critical bridges are being replaced by more robust designs, there are still thousands in service across the United States. To read more about two specific fracture critical collapses search the internet for the <em>Silver Bridge</em> collapse, or the <em>I-5 Skagit River Bridge</em> collapse. </p>

    <subsection xml:id="Chapter_06-solving-trusses">
      <title>Solving Trusses</title>
      <p><q>Solving</q> a truss means identifying and determining the unknown forces carried by the members of the truss when supporting the assumed load.   Because trusses contains only two-force members, these internal forces are all purely axial.  Internal forces in frames and machines will additionally include traverse forces and bending moments, as you will see in <xref ref="Chapter_08"/>.    </p>
      <p>Determining the internal forces is only the first step of a thorough analysis of a truss structure. Later steps would include refining the initial analysis by considering other load conditions, accounting for the weight of the members, relaxing the requirement that the members be connected with frictionless pins, and ultimately determining the stresses in the structural members and the dimensions required in order to prevent failure. </p>
      <p>Two strategies to solve trusses will be covered in the following sections: the <xref ref="method-of-joints" text="title"/> and the <xref ref="method-of-sections" text="title"/>.   Either method may be used, but the Method of Joints is usually easier when finding  the forces in all the members, while the Method of Sections is a more efficient way to solve for specific members without solving the entire truss. It’s also possible to mix and match methods. </p>
      <p>The initial steps to solve a truss are the same for both methods.  First, ensure that the structure can be modeled as a simple truss, then draw and label a sketch of the entire truss.  Each joint should be labeled with a letter, and the members will be identified by their endpoints, so member <m>AB</m> is the member between joints <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.  This will help you keep everything organized and consistent in later analysis. Then, treat the entire truss as a rigid body and solve for the external reactions using the methods of <xref ref="Chapter_05"/>.  If the truss is cantilevered and unsupported at one end you may not actually need the reaction forces and may skip this step.  The reaction forces can be used later to check your work.</p>

      <title>Zero-Force Members</title>
      <p>Sometimes a truss will contain one or more zero-force members.  As the name implies, zero-force members carry no force and thus support no load.  Zero-force members will be found when you apply equilibrium equations to the joints, but you can save some work if you can spot and eliminate them before you begin.  Fortunately, zero-force members can easily be identified by inspection with two rules.
<ul><li>Rule 1: If <em>two</em> non-collinear members meet at an unloaded joint, then both are zero-force members.</li><li>Rule 2: If <em>three</em> forces (interaction, reaction, or applied forces) meet at a joint and two are collinear, then the third is a zero-force member.</li></ul>

          <p>The original truss has been reduced to a simpler triangular structure with only three internal forces to be found.  Once you are able to spot zero force members, this simplification can be made without drawing any digrams or performing any calculations.</p>

        <title>Why include Zero-Force Members?</title>
        <p>You may be wondering what is the point of including a member in a truss if it supports no load. In our simplified example problems, they really are unnecessary, but in the real world, zero-force members are important for several reasons:
<ul><li>We have assumed that all members have negligible weight or if not, applied half the weight to each pin.  The <em>actual</em> weight of <em>real</em> members invalidates the two-force body assumption and leads to errors.  Consider a vertical member -- the internal forces must at least support the member’s weight.</li><li>Truss members are not actually rigid, and long slender members under compression will <em>buckle</em> and collapse. The so-called zero-force member will be engaged to prevent this buckling. In the previous example, members CD and DE are under compression and form an unstable equilibrium and would definitely buckle at pin <m>D</m> if they were not replaced with a single member <m>CE</m> with sufficient rigidity.</li><li>Trusses are often used over a wide array of loading conditions. While a member may be zero-force for one loading condition, it will likely be engaged under a different condition <mdash/> think about how the load on a bridge shifts as a heavy truck drives across.</li></ul>
            </p>
        <p>So finding a zero-force member in a determinate truss does not mean you can discard the member. Zero-force members can be thought of as removed from the analysis, but only for the loading you are currently analyzing. After removing zero-force members, you are left with the simplest truss which connects the reaction and applied forces with triangles. If you misinterpret the rules you may over-eliminate members and be left with missing legs of triangles or ‘floating’ forces that have no load path to the foundation.</p>

    <introduction>
      <p>	The <term>method of joints</term> is a process used to solve for the unknown forces acting on members of a truss. The method centers on the joints or connection points between the members, and it is most useful when you need to solve for all the unknown forces in a truss structure.</p>
      <p>The joints are treated of particles subjected to force by the connected members and any applied loads. As the joints are in equilibrium and the forces are concurrent, <m>\Sigma \vec{F} = 0</m> can be applied, but the <m>\Sigma M=0</m> equation provides no information.</p>
      <p>For planar trusses, each joint yields two scalar equations, <m>\Sigma F_x=0</m> and <m>\Sigma F_y=0</m>, and so two unknowns can be found.  Therefore,   a joint can be solved when there are one or two unknowns forces and at least one known force acting on it.</p>
      <p>Forces are transferred from joint to joint by the connecting members, so when unknown forces on a joint are found, the corresponding forces on adjacent joints are also found.</p>
    </introduction>
    <subsection xml:id="joints-procedure">

      <p>Rather than solving the joints sequentially, you could write out the equations for all the joints first and solve them simultaneously using a matrix solution, but only if you have a computer available as large matrices are not typically solvable with a calculator.</p>

      <p>The <term>method of sections</term> is used to solve for the unknown forces within specific members of a truss without solving for them all. The method involves dividing the truss into sections by cutting through the selected members and analyzing the section as a rigid body.

    <introduction>
      <p>Frame and machines are engineering structures that contain at least one multi-force member. As their name implies, multi-force members have more than two concentrated loads, distributed loads, and/or couples applied to them and therefore are not two-force members. Note that all bodies we investigated in <xref ref="Chapter_05"/> were all multi-force bodies. </p>
      <p>Analyzing a frame or machine means determining all applied, reaction, and internal forces and couples acting on the structure and all of its parts.</p>
      <p><term>Frames</term> are rigid, stationary structures designed to support loads and must include at least one multi-force member. </p>
      <p><term>Machines</term> are non-rigid structures where the parts can move relative to one another. Generally they have an input and an output force and are designed produce a mechanical advantage. Note that all machines in this text are in static equilibrium by their interacting and applied forces.</p>
      <p>Though there is a design difference between frames and machines they are grouped together because they can both be analyzed using the same process, which is the subject of this section.</p>

      <p>Analyzing frames and machines involves disassembling the structure into individual rigid bodies; we <q>take the structure apart</q> and analyze each part separately.  Each component is analyzed as an independent rigid body. This leads to equilibrium equations for each component, and by Newton’s Third Law, every interaction force and couple is one half of a complementary pair. The interacting force of body <m>A</m> on <m>B</m> is equal and opposite to the force of body <m>B</m> on body <m>A</m> and the free-body diagrams must reflect this.</p>
      <p>In  <xref ref="Chapter_05"/> we saw that each two-dimensional free-body diagram results in up to three linearly independent equations.  By disassembling the structure we now have more free-body diagrams available, and can use them to find more unknown values. Here’s a few more details on the number of equations that come from each type of two-dimensional free-body diagram:
<ul><li><em>Two-force members. One equation. </em> Two-force members can be recognized as either a cable or a weightless link with all forces coming from two frictionless pins.  The force at one pin is equal and opposite to the force on the other placing the body in tension or compression.</li><li><em>Objects with concurrent forces and no couple-moments. Two equations</em>  These are the problems you solved in <xref ref="Chapter_03"/>\.  There are two equations available <m>\Sigma F_x = 0</m>  and  <m>\Sigma F_y = 0</m>. </li><li><em>Multi-force rigid body with offset forces and/or couples.

      <insight>
        <title>Why does the Method of Joints work on trusses but fail on Frames and Machines?</title>
        <p>	We can solve trusses using the methods of joints and method of sections because all members of a simple truss are two-force bodies.  Cutting a truss member exposes an internal force which has an unknown scalar magnitude, but a known line of action.  The force acts along the axis of the member, and causes no bending if the member is straight.  Cutting a truss member exposes <em>one</em> unknown.</p>
        <p>Frames and machines are made of multi-force members and cutting these, in general, exposes:
<ul><li>A force with an unknown magnitude acting in an unknown direction, and </li><li>A bending moment at the plane of the cut. </li></ul>
            </p>
        <p>Cutting a two-dimensional multi-force member exposes <em>three</em> unknowns, and <em>six</em> are exposed for a three-dimensional body. The number of unknowns quickly eclipses the available equations rendering the problem impossible to solve. </p>
        <p>Bottom line: use method of sections and joints <em>only</em> for trusses made of two-force straight members; for all other multi-force rigid body systems draw and analyze free-body diagrams of the components.</p>

      <p>An object may be treated as a particle when the forces acting on it are coincident, that is, all of their lines of action intersect at a common point.  In this case, they produce no moment to rotate the object, and <m>\Sigma \vec{M} = 0</m> is not helpful.  The applicable equation is  <me>\Sigma \vec{F} = 0 </me>, which produces two scalar equations in two dimensions and three scalar equations in three dimensions.</p>

      <title>Rigid Body Equilibrium </title>
      <p>A rigid body can rotate and translate so both force and moment equilibrium must be considered.

      <title>Trusses</title>
      <p>A truss is a structure which consists entirely of two-force members and only carries forces at the joints connecting members.  Two-force members and loading at joints allows free-body diagram of the joints to expose the axial loads in members.  </p>
      <p>In addition to the equations provided by treating the entire truss as a rigid body, each joint provides two additional equations for two-dimensional trusses, and three for non-planar trusses.</p>

      <p>Frames and machines are structures which contain multiple rigid body systems.  Frames don't move and are designed to support loads.   Machines are generally designed to multiply forces, and usually have moving parts.  Both frames and machines can be solved using the same methods. </p>
