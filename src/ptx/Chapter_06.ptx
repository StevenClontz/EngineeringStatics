<title>Introduction</title>


<p>This chapter will build on what you learned in the previous rigid body equilibrium chapters <xref ref="Chapter_03"/> and <xref ref="Chapter_05"/>, by helping you to solve multiple-body structures. Broadly defined, a structure is any set of interconnected rigid bodies. The different bodies composing the structure may be able to move relative to one another, such as the blades in a pair of scissors shown below or they may be fixed relative to one another, such as the structural members within a bridge. Static analysis of structures involves the application of the equilibrium equations to solve for the forces acting on and between individual members of the structure.</p>

<title>Equilibrium Types</title>


<p>You might be wondering how the equilibrium of structures is different than the equilibrium of particles <xref ref="Chapter_03"/> and rigid bodies <xref ref="Chapter_05"/>. We will investigate the similarities and differences of equilibrium analysis for several types of systems. A summary table of these differences in Table 6-1.</p></paragraphs><table>

<p>As the approach and equations vary between systems, it is important to first determine the type of equilibrium problem to be solved. While the details related to the equilibrium of a particle or single rigid body should be reviewed; do not worry if the techniques and equations for trusses, frames, and machines are not clear at this point. We will frequently reference table 6-1 throughout this chapter and will share it again at the end of the chapter. A key skill you will learn in this chapter is to properly classifying a structure as a truss, which are made of all two-force members, versus a frame or machine, which each have at least one multi-force body. In trusses, frames and machines, properly identifying and analyzing two-force members is also very important.</p><paragraphs>

<title>Two-force Members</title>


<p>Every member of a truss is a two-force member. Recall from [xref 4.2.4 Two-force bodies] that a two-force member is a body which is subjected only to a pair of compression or tension forces with and no couples exerted anywhere on the body.</p>
<p/><figure xml:id="tension-compress">

<image width="65%" source="images/tension-compress.png"><remix><license href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC-BY-SA</license></remix></image></figure>
<p>For a two-force member to be in equilibrium, the force vectors need to be 1) equal in magnitude, 2) opposite in direction, and 3) collinear or sharing the same line of action. By this definition, two-force members are not required to be slender, straight members, but can always be recognized by having only two pins connected to other bodies/supports and having no other loading beyond external forces applied at the pins.</p>
<p>The common way to express the unknown axial force in each two-force member is with a magnitude and a sense, where the sense is expressed as either tension (T) or compression (C). To further investigate the nature of the pure axial forces of tension (T) and compression (C) let us look at the effect of tension pulling and compression pushing on each joint and member in the figure below.</p><figure xml:id="joints-members">

<caption>
 In the figure above, notice how the tension, in member AB, <em>pulls</em> on every member and joint, while the compression, in AD and BD, <em>pushes</em> on each member and joint. This diagram also helps us see that using the free-body diagrams of two-force members we can only verify that the forces are equal and opposite, but by using the free-body diagrams of the joints (which is detailed further in the Method of Joints below) we are able to include all reaction and applied forces as well.

<p/>
<p>When analyzing trusses, we are looking to identify the axial forces acting within each member for a given loading. In mechanics classes taken after Statics, you will be able to use these axial forces to select a material and design the cross sectional properties of each member. Later in Ch 8: Internal Loading within Rigid Bodies chapter of this book, you will analyze additional internal loadings in members, including shear force and bending moment.</p></paragraphs><assemblage xml:id="Chapter_06-introduction-thinking-deeper-equilibrium-of-multi-body-systems">

<title>Thinking Deeper: Equilibrium of Multi-Body Systems</title>


<p>When a complete truss is in equilibrium, each member of the truss, each joint, and each section are also in equilibrium. This continues all the way down to a single atom of the structure. This universal equilibrium across spatial scales is one of the governing principles which allows us to break multi-body systems into smaller solvable parts. </p>

<p>You will see in this chapter that we have the freedom to isolate free-body diagrams at any scale to expose our target unknowns. </p></assemblage><paragraphs>

<title>Interactions between members</title>


<p>As we are now dealing with multi-body systems, we need to revisit Newton's 3rd Law (from Chapter 1), <q>For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.</q> We apply this law to multi-body systems as the reactions applied to one body will be transferred equal and opposite to the interacting bodies. So practically we could restate Newton's 3rd law for interaction forces, <q>For every force on a body, there is an equal, opposite, and collinear force acting on the connecting body.</q></p></paragraphs><paragraphs>

<title>Load Paths</title>


<p>A basic concept that can help you think about structural systems is load paths. Load paths are conceptually how an applied load (like the gravity load in the image below) is passed through the interconnected members of a structural system and end up being supported by the reactions (which in the image below are the earth beneath the footings). All structural systems, whether non-moving frames or moving machines have some sort of load path. This is also a good concept to think about for your problem solving, where we need to computationally move from our known values (often applied loads) down through the interconnected bodies of the system, solving for unknowns as you go.</p><figure xml:id="load_paths">

<title>Overview of Simple Trusses</title>


<p>Simple trusses are made purely of straight two-force members pinned together and organized into triangles. Simple trusses, by definition, are statically determinate, having an equal number of equations and unknowns. While the members of real-life trusses stretch and compress under load, in this chapter we will maintain our assumption of all bodies in Statics being rigid.</p>
<p>To continue our discussion of trusses, it is worth defining the various types of forces that you will be using on truss free-body diagrams. These are the subset of forces you need to consider in truss systems. Since a truss system contains only two-force members, there will be no moments involved.</p>
<p><dl>
<li>

<title> Applied Forces</title>


<p> Applied forces are the external forces which a rigid body or system of rigid bodies is being designed to support. They are often given in a problem and you will be asked to find the reaction and interaction forces developed by them. </p></li>
<li>

<title> Body Forces</title>


<p> Body forces are gravitational weight forces of rigid bodies within a system. To maintain the assumption that trusses are formed of two-force members, all included weight forces must be split in two and distributed to the pins on either end of a truss member. </p></li>
<li>

<title> Reaction Forces</title>


<p> Reaction forces come from support pins, support rollers, or support two-force members interacting with the outside world. </p></li>
<li>

<title> Interaction Forces</title>


<p> Interaction forces are caused by the connection of one body with all the others it touches. Hence, when looking at the force on a pin joint, we would include all the forces coming from all members and reactions connected to that pin joint. </p></li>
<li>

<title> Internal Forces</title>


<p> Internal forces are the forces developed within the members of a truss. For trusses with straight members, the internal forces are compression and tension. </p></li></dl></p><assemblage xml:id="Chapter_06-simple-trusses-overview-of-simple-trusses-thinking-deeper-the-danger-of-simple-trusses">

<title>Thinking Deeper: The Danger of Simple Trusses</title>


<p>Simple trusses have no structural redundancy, which makes them easy to solve using the techniques of this chapter, however this simplicity also has a dark side.  </p><sidebyside width="75%"><image source="images/1024px-NTSBSkagitRiverBridgeCollapse.jpg"><remix><creator>US Department of Transportation NSTB</creator><source href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:NTSBSkagitRiverBridgeCollapse.jpg"/><license href="https://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/">CC-0</license></remix></image></sidebyside>
<p>These trusses are sometimes called  <em>fracture critical trusses</em> because the failure of a single component can lead to catastrophic failure of the entire structure.  With no redundancy, there is no alternative load path for the forces that normally would be supported by that member. You can visualize the fracture critical nature of simple trusses by thinking about a triangle with pinned corners. If one side of a triangle fails, the other two sides lose their support and will collapse. In a full truss made of only triangles, the collapse of one triangle starts a chain reaction which causes others to collapse as well. </p>
<p>While fracture critical bridges are being replaced by more robust designs, there are still thousands in service across the United States. To read more about two specific fracture critical collapses search the internet for:

<li>I-5 Bridge Collapse Skagit River </li></ul></p></assemblage></subsection><subsection xml:id="identify-simple-truss">

<title>Identifying Simple Trusses</title>


<p>As discussed in Table 6-1 there are some rules which separate simple trusses from other systems of rigid bodies. 
<ul label="square">
<li>Simple trusses are made of all two-force members and all joints are modeled as frictionless pins. All applied and reaction forces are applied only to these joints.</li>
<li>Simple trusses are made of triangles, which makes them rigid when removed from supports. Simple trusses are determinate, having a balance of equations and unknowns, following the equation: <me>\underbrace{2\times (\text{number of joints})}_{\text{system equations}} = \underbrace{(\text{number of reaction forces}) + (\text{number of members})}_{\text{system unknowns}}</me></li></ul></p>
<p/>
<p>A few additional notes include:
<ul label="square">
<li>Commonly, rigid trusses have only three reaction forces, resulting in the equation: <me>2\times (\text{number of joints})=3 + (\text{number of members})</me></li>
<li>Unstable trusses lack the structural members to maintain their rigidity when removed from their supports. They can also be recognized using the equation above having more system equations on the left side of the equation above then system unknowns on the right.</li>
<li>Truss systems with redundant members have fewer system equations on the left side of the equation above than the system unknowns on the right. While they are indeterminate in Statics, in later courses you will learn equations to solve for member stretching and compression you will gain more equations for these trusses can be solved</li></ul></p><assemblage xml:id="identify-simple-truss-exposed-vs-unexposed-internal-forces">

<title>Exposed vs. Unexposed Internal Forces</title>


<p>Cutting a straight member in a truss exposes the internal force which must be properly represented on the free-body diagram. Internal forces of a truss are all in equal and opposite pairs, think about the tension forces in a two-force member being equal and opposite pulling on each end. Hence, all interaction and internal forces which are not exposed by cutting or isolating members have an opposing force which effectively cancels them out. Only when we cut through a member or joint in the isolation step of creating a free-body diagram, do we expose all the forces which come from the interaction of the surrounding bodies. </p></assemblage></subsection><subsection xml:id="Chapter_06-simple-trusses-common-labeling-practices">

<title>Common Labeling Practices</title>


<p>After you have validated that a system can be modeled as a simple truss using the rules above, make sure that all joints and members are labeled. This will help you keep everything organized and consistent in later analysis. In this book, the joints will be labeled with letters and the members will be labeled with the joints they are connected to.</p><figure xml:id="joint-labels">

The first step in the method of joints is to label each joint and each member.

<title>Solving for Reactions</title>


<p>As trusses are themselves rigid bodies, you can solve for their reaction forces using a free-body diagram of the full truss (before starting xref Method of Sections or xref Method of Joints) just like you did in <xref ref="Chapter_05"/> Rigid Body Equilibrium. Hence to solve for the reactions, draw a free body diagram, write out the equilibrium equations, and solve for the external reaction forces acting on the truss structure. </p>
<p/><figure xml:id="truss_reactions">

To solve for the reaction forces, in this case, <m>A_y</m>, <m>C_x</m>, and <m>C_y</m>, treat the entire truss as a rigid body and solve for the reaction forces supporting the truss structure.

<title>Zero-Force Members</title>


<p>As their name implies, zero-force members are not engaged by the specific loads applied to a truss. While you can find zero-force members using either Method of Joints or Sections, you can save a lot of computational time by identifying them with two simple rules.
<ul label="square">
<li>Rule 1: If <em>two</em> members meet at an unloaded joint, then both members are zero-force members.</li>
<li>Rule 2: If <em>three</em> forces (interaction, reaction, or applied forces) meet at a joint and two are collinear, then the third is a zero-force member.</li></ul></p>
<p>While it is probably easiest to conceptualize this rule when the third member is perpendicular to the collinear pair, it does not have to be. If you sum forces perpendicular to the collinear pair if even a component of the third member is zero, the whole member must be a zero-force member.</p>
<p>Additional key points to keep in mind regarding zero-force members include:
<ul label="square">
<li>Finding zero-force members is iterative. Once you find some, eliminate them and go look for others.</li>
<li>The zero-force rules above only have to apply to one end of a member (not both) to determine that the whole member is a zero-force member. Keep in mind that all zero-force members started as two-force members which have exactly the same axial load on either end, hence if one end has zero force, the other does as well.</li></ul></p>
<p>While finding zero-force members is a handy tool to minimize computations in Statics. In the real world, zero-force members may have minimal axial forces, but not truly ‘zero force’ for multiple reasons:
<ul label="square">
<li>The weight of members is typically ignored in Statics truss computations. Even if we distributed the member weight to the pins as required to keep the members two-force, these additional pin forces would tend to negate either rule.</li>
<li>Another function of truss members is to support the members they interact with as members deform under load. When we call a member a zero force, we essentially remove it from our analysis. One issue with this is if the member it is attached to begins buckling in compression, the zero-force member will be engaged to prevent this buckling. </li>
<li>Trusses are often used over a wide array of loading conditions - think about how the position of the weight of a truck changes relative to the bridge it is driving over. Thus, while a member may have zero force for one load condition, it will likely be engaged given other loading conditions.</li></ul></p><investigation xml:id="zero-force-members-zero-force-member-example-">

<p>Finally, finding a zero-force member in a determinate truss does not mean you can discard the member. Stability is always a loading-independent issue. Zero-force members can be thought of as removed from the analysis but this is only true for the exact loading you are currently analyzing. After removing zero-force members, you are left with the simplest truss which will still connect the reaction and applied forces with triangles. If you misinterpret the rules you may over-eliminate members and be left with missing legs of triangles or ‘floating’ forces that have no load path from the remaining members.</p>
<p>There are two major strategies used to identify the unknown forces in a truss, these are the <xref ref="method-of-joints"/> and the <xref ref="method-of-sections"/>. The Method of Joints is usually easier if you wish to find the forces in all members, while the Method of Sections makes it easier to find the forces in a specific or specific set of members. It’s also possible to mix and match methods when necessary.</p></subsection></section><section xml:id="method-of-joints">

<title>The Method of Joints</title>

<objectives><introduction>
<p>At the end of this chapter you should be able to answer these questions.</p></introduction><ul>
<li>What are the important components to include on a free-body diagram of a joint in a truss?</li>
<li>How are the solutions found at one joint used to create an accurate free-body diagram of another joint?</li>
<li>How do we ensure that tension or compression in a member is properly represented?</li></ul></objectives>
<p>The <term>method of joints</term> is a process used to solve for the unknown forces acting on members of a <term>truss</term>. The method centers on the joints or connection points between the members, and it is useful if you need to solve for all the unknown forces in a truss structure.</p>
<p> The process used in the method of joints is outlined below: <ol>
<li>
<p>First, determine if the structure is a truss and if it is determinate. See <xref ref="identify-simple-truss"/></p></li>
<li>
<p>Identify and eliminate all zero-force members. This is not required, but can minimize your computations. See <xref ref="zero-force-members"/> above.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Next, determine if you need to solve for the reactions first using the full section free-body diagram, or if you can solve for them as part of the Method of Joints. Joints are treated as a series of particles. As all forces on joints are concurrent, these forces can be solved with equilibrium force equations, but moment equations do not add any information. Thus each 2D joint yields two equations (<m>\Sigma F_x=0</m> and <m>\Sigma F_y=0</m>). To be able to solve for the unknowns at a joint in a step-by-step fashion, you’ll need ≤ 2 unknowns at each joint and ≥ 1 known force at each joint. If there are no joints that satisfy this condition and you would like to solve for the unknown forces in a step-by-step manner, then you will need to solve for the truss reactions first before starting the Method of Joints.</p>
<p>Note that you could write out all the equations for each free-body diagram and solve them all simultaneously with a linear algebra matrix solution, but only if you have a computer available as large matrices are not typically solvable with a calculator.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Next, represent the forces at each joint with a free body diagram. It is simplest to:
<ul label="square">
<li>Draw one joint free-body diagram at a time</li>
<li>Always draw known forces in their known direction and value (whether external, reaction, or interaction),</li>

<title>The Method of Sections</title>

<objectives><introduction>
<p>At the end of this chapter you should be able to answer these questions.</p></introduction><ul>
<li>How do we determine an appropriate section to cut through a truss?</li>
<li>How are equilibrium equations applied to a section?</li></ul></objectives>
<p>The Method of Sections is a more targeted process than the Method of Joints, which is used to solve for the unknown forces within a limited number of members in a truss. The method involves cutting the truss into individual sections and analyzing each section as a separate rigid body. The advantage of the Method of Sections is that the only internal member forces exposed are those which you have cut through, the remaining internal forces are not exposed and thus ignored.</p><paragraphs>

<title>Using the Method of Sections</title>


<p>First, determine if a truss can be modeled as a simple truss (see Identifying Simple Trusses above).</p>
<p>Identify and eliminate all zero-force members. The eliminate of zero-force members is not required but can minimize your computations, see Zero-Force Members above.</p>
<p>Next, take out your imaginary chain saw and evaluate various section cuts through the entire truss. These cuts should include some (or all) of the members you are asked to solve for. </p>
<p>Note that every cut member exposes the internal axial force which exists in that member. Hence if you cut three members, you’ll have three new unknowns to solve for. Exposing four (or more) members is not advised as you only have three equilibrium equations to solve for the exposed axial force unknown values. </p>
<p>Technically, the cut does not need to be a straight line, but often it is.</p>

<li>Solve for reactions (if needed). If your section free-body diagram will include reaction forces, go back to your full section free-body diagram and solve for the reactions you will need on your section free-body diagram. </li>
<li>Draw your section free-body diagram:</li>
<li>	Always draw known forces in their known direction and value (whether external, reaction, or interaction) and make sure to include any applied and reaction force which are also applied to the portion of your truss remaining. </li>
<li>	Draw unknown forces in assumed directions and uniquely label them. A common practice for trusses is to assume that all unknown forces are in tension (or pulling away from the free-body diagram of the pin) and label them based on the member they represent (like <m>F_{AB}</m>).</li>

<title>Frames and Machines</title>


<p>Frame and machines are engineering structures that contain at least one multi-force member. As their name implies, multi-force members have more than two points of application of point loads, distributed loads present and/or couples applied to them and therefore are not two-force members. Note that all bodies we investigated in Ch 5 Equilibrium of Rigid Bodies were all multi-force bodies. Refer to Table 6-1 for the details of how frames and machines compare to other equilibrium systems.</p>
<p>By definition:</p>
<p><term>Frames</term> are rigid, stationary structures designed to support loads, and must include at least one multi-force member. </p>
<p><term>Machines</term> are non-rigid structures where the parts can move relative to one another. Generally they have an input and an output force and are designed produce a mechanical advantage. Note that all machines in this text are in static equilibrium by given their interacting and applied forces.</p>
<p>Though there is a design difference between frames and machines they are grouped together because they can both be analyzed using the same process, which is the subject of this section.</p><sidebyside widths="50% 50%"><figure xml:id="stool">

<caption>
This stool is a frame as its legs are not two force members and is rigid, therefore no part can move relative to the other parts.

This pair of locking pliers is a machine as it contains multi-force members and has parts that can move relative to one another.

<image source="images/vice-grips-photo.jpg"><remix/></image></figure></sidebyside>
<p>Analyzing a frame or machine means determining all applied, reaction, and internal forces and couples acting on the structure.</p>
<p>The method used to analyze frames involves disassembling the structure into individual rigid bodies; we <q>take the structure apart.</q> and analyze each part separately.  Each component is analyzed as an independent rigid body. This leads to equilibrium equations for each component, and due to Newton's Third Law, every interaction force and couple is one half of a complementary pair. The interacting force of body <m>A</m> on <m>B</m> is equal and opposite to the force of body <m>B</m> on body <m>A</m> and the free body diagrams must reflect this.</p>
<p>Remember from Chapter 5 Rigid Body Equilibrium how you were limited to three linearly independent equations per rigid body free-body diagram? It turns out that the relationship still holds here, but now we have more free-body diagrams to use. Here’s a few more details on the number of equations that come from each type of two-dimensional free-body diagram:
<ul label="square">
<li><em>Two-force members. One equation:</em> Recall that two-force members can be recognized as either a cable or a weightless link with all forces coming from two frictionless pins. The available equation simply tells you that the force at one pin is equal and opposite to the force on the other placing the body in tension or compression.</li>
<li><em>Multi-force rigid body with concurrent forces. Two equations:</em> These are the same type of problems you solved in Ch. 3: Equilibrium of Particles with only two equations available <m>\Sigma F_x = 0</m>  and  <m>\Sigma F_y = 0</m>. </li>
<li><em>Multi-force rigid body with offset forces and/or couples. Three equations:</em> These are the most general body types where you can use  <m>\Sigma F_x = 0</m>,  <m>\Sigma F_y = 0</m>,  and<m> \Sigma M = 0</m> to solve for three unknowns.</li></ul></p></subsection><subsection xml:id="frames-and-machines-analysis-procedure">

<title>Analysis Procedure</title>


<p>The process used to analyze frames and machines is outlined below:
<ol>
<li>
<p>First, determine if we can model the entire structure as a rigid body. </p>
<p>To do this, the structure needs to be independently rigid. This means that it would be rigid even if we separated it from its supports. Look for triangles formed among the members, as triangles are inherently rigid.</p>
<p>If the structure is independently rigid, you will be able to model the structure as a single rigid body to determine the reaction forces acting on the structure. If the structure is not independently rigid then skip this step.</p>
<p/><figure xml:id="frame-ex-1">

<caption>
If, and only if, the structure is independently rigid, you should analyze the whole structure as a single rigid body to solve for the reaction forces. Note the triangle formed between pins <m>B</m>, <m>C</m>, and <m>D</m>.

<li>
<p>Next draw a free body diagram for each of the members in the structure. You will need to include all forces acting on each member, including:
<ul label="square">
<li>All applied forces/couples that may be acting at the members.</li>
<li>Interaction forces from two-force members. Recall, at connection points with two-force members there will be single force of unknown magnitude but the known direction (the forces will act along the line between the two connection points on the member).</li>
<li>Next, add in the remaining reaction forces/couples at the connection points between members. For forces with an unknown magnitude and direction (such as in pin joints) the forces are often drawn in as having unknown x and y components.</li></ul></p>
<p>Remember that the interaction forces/couples between connected bodies will be equal and opposite.</p><figure xml:id="frame-ex-2">

<caption>
Separate the structure into individual components and draw a free body diagram of each component. It is important to remember that the forces at each connection point are equal and opposite.

<li>
<p>Write out the equilibrium equations for each free-body diagram. </p></li>
<li>
<p>Finally, solve the equilibrium equations for the unknowns. You can do this algebraically, solving for one variable at a time, or you can use matrix equations to solve for everything at once. If your algebra tells you that any force/couple is negative, that indicates that the assumed direction of that term should be flipped in direction.</p></li></ol></p><assemblage xml:id="frames-and-machines-analysis-procedure-thinking-deeper-why-does-the-method-of-joints-work-on-trusses-but-fail-on-frames-and-machines">

<title>Thinking Deeper: Why does the Method of Joints work on trusses but fail on Frames and Machines?</title>


<p>We can solve trusses using the methods of joints and method of sections because all members of a truss are considered to be two-force bodies.  Cutting a truss member exposes an internal force which has an unknown scalar magnitude, but a known line of action.  The force acts along the axis of the member, and causes no bending if the member is straight.  Cutting a truss member exposes <em>one</em> unknown.</p>
<p>Frames and machines are made of multi-force members and cutting these, in general, exposes:
<ul label="square">
<li>A force with an unknown magnitude acting in an unknown direction. </li>
<li>A bending moment at the plane of the cut. </li></ul></p>
<p>Cutting a two-dimensional multi-force member exposes <em>three</em> unknowns, and <em>six</em> are exposed for a three-dimensional body. The number of unknowns quickly eclipses the available equations rendering the problem impossible to solve. </p>
<p>Bottom line: use method of sections and joints <em>only</em> for trusses made of two-force straight members; for all other multi-force rigid body systems, draw and analyze free body diagrams of the components.</p></assemblage></subsection></section><section xml:id="Chapter_06-chapter-review">
