<title>Overview</title>


<p>by William Haynes @weh</p>
<p>We will be authoring the Engineering Statics book using <url href="https://pretextbook.org">PreTeXt</url>[[Markdown Link]],  storing  the text, images and interactives on <url href="github.com">GitHub</url>[[Markdown Link]] using <url href="https://git-scm.com">git</url>[[Markdown Link]], and converting everything into a website and a pdf book using <url href="https://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/">XSLT</url>[[Markdown Link]].  Finally we will post everything it on our <url href="https://EngineeringStatics.org">website</url>[[Markdown Link]] for students to use.</p>
<p><pretext/> consists of two pieces, the XML markup and the XSLT processor.</p>
<p>The source documents for the book are text files marked up using XML tags, similar to the way HTML documents are marked up, but the tags are specific to the requirements of academic textbooks.   We will be using the extension  <c>.ptx</c> to indicate <pretext/> files.  The <pretext/> tags are formally defined by an <url href="https://pretextbook.org/doc/schema-litprog/pretext.pdf">XML Schema</url>[[Markdown Link]], which specifies what are legal tags and where they can be used.</p>
<p>Most likely you will want to see what the final result of your writing looks like.  In order to see it in its final version,  you can compile it with XSLT to create a local copy of the final version</p></subsection><subsection xml:id="pretext-info-workflow">

<title>Workflow</title>


<p>The main components necessary to make this all work are: </p>
<p><ul><li>Local copies of the <pretext/> and Engineering Statics files</li><li>An XML aware text editor to edit the <pretext/> source.</li><li>The command line program git and a GitHub account.</li><li>An XSLT processor to convert the source text to html</li></ul></p>
<p>When you have these installed and working on your computer, you will have everything you need to produce a local copy of the entire book. That way, you can edit something and then test it to see what it will look like in its final form.  When you are satisfied with your work, you will use git to send it to the GitHub, where Dan or Will will integrate it into its proper place in the book, publish and upload to the website.  </p>
<p>If this sounds daunting to you, don't worry!  <em>You don't have to do any of this while you create your first draft</em>.  Please just write! Use any tools you are comfortable with, and I (@weh) will do the initial markup to <pretext/> for you.  However, marking up the the draft is a one way trip.  After that, any further edits and improvements must be made on the <pretext/> source.   Don't spend any effort trying to make your draft look pretty because all styling will be handled by <pretext/>.</p></subsection><subsection xml:id="pretext-info-getting-set-up">

<title>Getting set up</title>


<p>The <url href="https://pretextbook.org">PreTeXt</url>[[Markdown Link]] website has plenty of information on how  to get started with <pretext/>.  You will find quickstart instructions on the homepage which may be all you need as well as more detailed instructions and walkthrough videos.</p>
<p><url href="https://pretextbook.org/doc/pnw/html/novices.html">PreTeXt for Novices Using Windows</url>[[Markdown Link]] has a detailed description of how to install the necessary tools.</p>
<p><url href="https://pretextbook.org/doc/guide/html/">Pretext Guide</url>[[Markdown Link]] is the place to learn about <pretext/> and get started.</p>
<p><url href="https://pretextbook.org/gfa/html/">Git for Authors</url>[[Markdown Link]] describes how to use git to add your content and corrections to the official repository.</p></subsection><subsection xml:id="pretext-info-pretext-tags">

<title><pretext/> tags</title>


<p>Here is a list of commonly used <pretext/> tags. Their purposes are mostly self evident. </p>
<p>For details on the use of tags see Chapter 3 of the <url href="https://pretextbook.org/doc/author-guide/html/overview.html">Author's Guide</url>[[Markdown Link]].</p>

<p>The <url href="https://pretextbook.org/doc/schema/">Pretext Schema</url>[[Markdown Link]] describes the <pretext/> vocabulary: the legal tags and how they nest. It's formal and confusing, so you may be better off looking at the source of documents that do what you want first. Another reference is and the <url href="https://pretextbook.org/doc/schema-litprog/pretext.pdf">Schema documentation</url>[[Markdown Link]] which describes the schema </p></subsection><subsection xml:id="pretext-info-customizations">

<title>Customizations</title>


<p>I'll try to list all customizations any non-standard <pretext/> behaviors that I have implemented here.</p>
<p>I've defined some latex macros in docinfo.ptx so </p>
<p>		 <c>\vec{A}</c> will produce <m>\vec{A}</m></p>
<p>		 <c>\ihat</c> will produce <m>\ihat</m></p>
<p>		 <c>\jhat</c> will produce <m>\jhat</m></p>
<p>		 <c>\khat</c> will produce <m>\khat</m></p></subsection><subsection xml:id="pretext-info-images">

<title>Images</title>


<p>The preferred image types for the book for diagrams or drawings is <term>Scalable Vector Graphics</term>.  This format should be used for any diagrams or drawings you make if possible.   <c>SVG</c> files can be created with Inkscape, Geogebra, or other tools.  My CAD program doesn't natively export SVG files, but I can "print as pdf" and convert that file to an editable .svg file using the command line tool  <c>pdf2svg</c>.  Any diagram you create should have an 'actual' height of about 100 mm or 4 inches, or taller if necessary, but not more that 1 page tall  Diagrams will get scaled down when they go into the book.  On the web version, clicking on the scaled image will pop up a larger image.</p>
<p>One huge advantages of SVG files is that they any text including <latex/> in the diagram gets properly rendered when it is placed in the book, so that the diagram text appears in the same font and size as the rest of the book.  Otherwise, if you have text elements in a diagram, they will get scaled along with the digram and may become unreadable at small sizes.</p>
<p>To do this, somehow create an svg diagram, using Inkscape, cad, geogebra or another vector drawing program. For annotated photographs, create a SVG file and import the the png image, then use the SVG tools to add text and arrows, etc. </p>
<p> When you are finished creating the svg file, open it with Inkscape and "save as pdf", and choose the option "omit text in pdf and create <latex/> file." and save this in the same directory.  Two files will be created, a .pdf file with no text, and a .pdf_tex file which is a standalone <latex/> file which overlays properly rendered text on top of the .pdf image.</p>
<p>Keep all resources used to produce each diagram together in a folder under your chapter in the /ptx/src/resources directory together. All ggb, jpg, png, svg, pdf and pdf_tex files will be copied from here to a common images folder for inclusion into the document. This way, images can be inserted by using their filename only.  Since all images will be in the same folder, no path is necessary, but all filenames must be unique so avoid common names like  <c>fbd.svg</c>.</p>
<p>Other acceptable file types</p>
<p>Use <term>Portable Document Format</term>, .pdf to include things like manufacturers spec sheets.  You can use pdf for line drawing with no text</p>
<p>Use <term>Portable Network Graphics,</term> .png in preference to .jpg for photographs.</p><paragraphs>

<title>Example</title>


<p>Here's an example of a svg image with text rendered by latex overlaid. The composite image was saved as an svg file, then a copy was saved as a pdf file without text, along with balloon.pdf_tex which was included in the source ptx as shown.</p><figure>

<caption>Image with overlaid text.</caption>

<image width="75%"><latex-image>
\pdftex{balloon}
</latex-image></image></figure>
<p>This image was composed of three parts,</p>
<p><ol><li>The x-z plane and the three ropes were drawn in Geogebra, and a screenshot was used to capture the image as a png.  For 2D drawings Geogebra can export svg or png directly.</li><li>The balloon was a png image.</li><li>Both were imported into a svg image in Inkscape, where the axis labels, point labels, and the height were added with the text tool. The dotted line, and the dimension arrows were drawn in using Inkscape's tools.</li></ol></p>
<p>If you look in the ptx/resources/ch03/balloon directory you will find all the intermediate files I used They are:</p>
<p><ul><li><em>chap_2_P8.png</em> Jacob's original diagram</li><li><em>balloononly.png</em> The Balloon image without the lines or the dimensions, which I pulled and cleaned up from the original with photoshop. </li><li><em>background.ggb</em> A Geogebra file which I made to draw the ground plane and the cables </li><li><em>background.png</em> The exported images from geogebra. Unfortunately Geogebra won't export 3d diagrams as svg, so I used png. </li><li><em>balloon.svg</em>  A composite diagram I made in inkscape combining <em>ballooononly.png</em> and background.png and latex labels.</li><li><em>balloon.pdf</em> This file is the image without text, as exported from Inkscape</li><li><em>balloon.pdf_tex</em> This file contains the instructions for the text and where to place it on top of balloon.pdf</li></ul></p>
<p>When <pretext/> Generates the book it makes a pdf file which composites the text on top of the ballon and inserts it into the Latex version of the book, and it also uses the <em>pdf2svg</em> to make an SVG version to use for the web version</p>

<title>MBX</title>


<p>I had some trouble getting the  <c>mbx</c> program working, with the message</p><pre>
  File "/Users/whaynes/ptx/mathbook/script/mbx", line 771, in youtube_thumbnail
    import requests
ImportError: No module named requests
</pre>
<p>I tried installing the requests module with </p><pre> ==&gt;  sudo pip install requests</pre>
<p>But it didn't work :(</p>
<p>The problem was that when I tried to import the requests module with pip, it got installed into the wrong version of python.  I had to do this to straighten it out.  I'm using <url href="maports.org">macPorts</url>.</p><pre>
==&gt;  port select --list python
Available versions for python:
none
python27 (active)
python27-apple
python37 

 ==&gt;  port select --list pip
Available versions for pip:
none
pip27
pip37 (active)

 ==&gt;  sudo port select --set pip pip27
Selecting 'pip27' for 'pip' succeeded. 'pip27' is now active.

 ==&gt;  sudo pip install requests

</pre>
<p>Also, to get the  <c>mbx</c> program to work, I had to install <url href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/pageres-cli">pageres-cli</url> which required installation of <url href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">nodejs</url>. On mac, this resulted in an installation error due to file permissions, and was resolved by installing pagres-cli this way sudo </p><pre>&gt; npm install --global pageres-cli --unsafe-perm=true</pre></subsection></section><section xml:id="demos">

<title>Sage Demo</title>


<p>Sage is an open-source mathematics system which uses a Python-based syntax, which can be used to do complex calculation right in the browser. In the pdf version, a sample result is shown.</p>
<p>Recall that the moment of a force about a point is the cross product of the force <m>\vec{F}</m> with the position vector <m>\vec{r}</m>.</p>
<p><md><mrow>\vec{M} = \vec{r} \times \vec{F}= \begin{vmatrix} \vec{i} \amp \vec{j} \amp \vec{k} </mrow><mrow>r_x \amp r_y \amp r_z\\ F_x \amp F_y \amp F_z \end{vmatrix}</mrow></md></p>
<p>Given <m>\vec{r} = 4 \vec{i} + 5 \vec{j} - 2 \vec{k}</m> meters and <m>\vec{F} = 80 \vec{i} + 40 \vec{j} - 30 \vec{k}</m> kN you can find the moment <m>\vec{M}</m> by entering the following into the Sage Cell below. When you click  <c>Evaluate (Sage)</c> the components of <m>\vec{M}</m> will be calculated.</p><sage><input> r = vector([4, 5, -2]); F = vector([80, 40, -30]); r.cross_product(F) </input><output> (-70, -40, -240) </output></sage>
<p>Note that you are defining <m>\vec{F}</m> and <m>\vec{r}</m>, and in the third line  <c>r.cross_product(F)</c> is the expression to be evaluated. You'll have to work out the correct units for the moment yourself, however.</p></subsection><subsection xml:id="demos-numbas">
