Diagram provenance

Jacob Moore created the original problem
I created background.ggb and screenshot it to produce background.png
I cropped the balloon from Jacob's orignal problem
I composited them together in Inkscape and added labels
I exported that as balloon.svg
I also exported balloon.pdf and balloon.pdf_tex for insertion into the static book

I release the results as CC-BY
