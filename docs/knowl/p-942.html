<p>Analysis of structures involves determining all forces acting on and between individual members of the structure.  Fundamentally there is nothing new here; the techniques you have already learned apply, however structures tend to have more unknown forces, and so are more involved and provide more opportunities for error than the problems you have previously encountered.  Correct free-body diagrams and careful work are required, as always.</p>
