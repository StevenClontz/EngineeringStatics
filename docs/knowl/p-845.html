<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">For a body to be in static equilibrium, all possible movements of the body need to be adequately restrained. If a degree of freedom is not restrained, the body is in an unstable state and is not “static.” Stability is highly desirable for reasons of human safety, and bodies are often restrained by <em class="emphasis">lots</em> of restraints so that if one were to fail, the body would still be stable. If the restraints correctly interpreted, then equal constraints and degrees of freedom create a stable system. If the number of restraints exceeds the number of degrees of freedom, the body is in equilibrium, but you will need more equations than we cover in statics determine their values.</p>
