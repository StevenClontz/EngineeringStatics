<p>For a body to be in static equilibrium, all possible movements of the body need to be adequately restrained. If a degree of freedom is not restrained, the body is in an unstable state, free to move in one or more ways.  Stability is highly desirable for reasons of human safety, and bodies are often restrained by <em class="emphasis">redundant</em> restraints so that if one were to fail, the body would still remain stable. If the restraints correctly interpreted, then equal constraints and degrees of freedom create a stable system, and the values of the reaction forces and moments can be determined using equilibrium equations.  If the number of restraints exceeds the number of degrees of freedom, the body is in equilibrium but you will need techniques we won't cover in statics to determine the reactions.</p>
