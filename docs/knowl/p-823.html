<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">While following one of the three rules above does guarantee the <em class="emphasis">independence</em> of your equations, you have further freedom to choose equations that help you to find efficient solutions. Efficiency, in this case, is defined as the desire to avoid simultaneous equations when possible. This efficiency is based on the fact that equations with only a single unknown are faster to solve than multiple-unknown equations that require substitution, linear algebra, or other solution techniques. The four choices which contribute to setting up efficient equations are the selection of 1) equilibrium equations, 2) the axis, 3) the points you sum moments around, and finally, 4) the <em class="emphasis">order</em> in which you solve the equations.</p>
