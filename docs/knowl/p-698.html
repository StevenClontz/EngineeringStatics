<p>The most commonly used model for dry friction is Coulomb friction, which includes phases (as shown in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/function_CC.html" title="Figure 5.3">FigureÂ 5.3</a> below): (1) static but not impending friction, (2) impending motion, and (3) kinetic friction. Coulomb friction relies on a friction coefficient \(\mu\) to serve as the proportionality constant between the normal and friction forces. The friction coefficient \mu is always greater than 0 and commonly less than 1. The friction coefficient can be greater than 1 for materials that exhibit positive adhesion to each other (like silicone rubber or glued surfaces).</p>
