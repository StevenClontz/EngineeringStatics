<p>Using triangle-based geometry to solve vector problems is a quick and powerful tool, but includes the following limitations:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>There are only three sides in a triangle; thus vectors can only be added two at a time. If you need to add three or more vectors using this method, you must add the first two, then add the third to that sum and so on.</p></li>
<li><p>If you fail to draw the correct vector triangle, or identify the known sides and angles you will not find the correct answer.</p></li>
<li><p>The trigonometric functions are scalar functions. They are quick ways of solving for the magnitudes of vectors and the angle between vectors, but you may still need to find the vector components from a given datum.</p></li>
</ul>
