<p>Determining the bounding functions and setting up the integrals is usually the most difficult part of problems like this. Begin by drawing and labeling a sketch of the situation.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Place a point in the first quadrant and label it <span class="process-math">\(P=(a,b)\text{.}\)</span> This point is in the first quadrant and fixed since we are told that <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> are positive integers</p></li>
<li><p>Place a horizontal line through <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> to make the upper bound.</p></li>
<li><p>Sketch in a parabola with a vertex at the origin and passing through <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> and shade in the enclosed area.</p></li>
<li><p>Decide which differential element you intend to use. For this example we choose to use vertical strips, which you can see if you tick  <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">show strips</code> in the interactive above.  Horizontal strips <span class="process-math">\(dA = x\ dy\)</span> would give the same result, but you would need to define the equation for the parabola in terms of <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
</ol>
<p>Determining the equation of the parabola and expressing it in terms of of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and any known constants is a critical step.  You should remember from algebra that the general equation of parabola with a vertex at the origin is <span class="process-math">\(y = k x^2\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> is a constant which determines the shape of the parabola.  If <span class="process-math">\(k \gt 0\text{,}\)</span> the parabola opens upward and if <span class="process-math">\(k \lt 0\text{,}\)</span> the parabola opens downward.</p>
<p>To find the value of <span class="process-math">\(k\text{,}\)</span> substitute the coordinates of <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> into the general equation, then solve for <span class="process-math">\(k\text{.}\)</span></p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{align*}
y \amp = k x^2, \text{ so at } P \\
(b) \amp = k (a)^2\\
k \amp= \frac{b}{a^2}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>The resulting function of the parabola is</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
y = y(x) = \frac{b}{a^2} x^2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>To perform the integrations, express the area and centroidal coordinates of the element in terms of the points at the top and bottom of the strip.  The area of the strip is its height times its base, so</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
dA = (b-y)\ dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">If you incorrectly used <span class="process-math">\(dA =  y\ dx\text{,}\)</span> you would find the centroid of the spandrel below the curve.</p>
<p>For vertical strips, the bottom is at <span class="process-math">\((x,y)\)</span> on the parabola, and the top is directly above at <span class="process-math">\((x,b)\text{.}\)</span>  The strip has a differential width <span class="process-math">\(dx\text{.}\)</span> The centroid of the strip is located at its midpoint and the coordinates are are found by averaging the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> coordinates of the points at the top and bottom.</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{align*}
\bar{x}_{\text{el}} \amp =  (x + x)/2 = x\\
\bar{y}_{\text{el}} \amp =  (y+b)/2
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>For vertical strips, the integrations are with respect to <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> and the limits on the integrals are <span class="process-math">\(x=0\)</span> on the left to <span class="process-math">\(x = a\)</span> on the right.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="centroids-by-integration.html#li-405" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
