<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">For computational simplicity, all screw problems in this course will focus on square-threaded screws. Note that other threading shapes (like Acme or Trapezoidal threads) are also common, but their angled threads increase the computational complexity. The easiest way to analyze a square-thread power screw system is to turn the problem into a two-dimensional problem by "unwrapping" the ramp from around the cylinder of the shaft. We can summarize the geometry of the screw using two values (1) the mean radius of the screw (r) and secondly the lead (l) (also called the pitch), which is the distance between two adjacent threads. Alternately, you can compute the lead by computing the inverse of the threads-per-inch or centimeter. With a single thread design, this will also be the number of times the thread wraps around the screw in one inch/centimeter.</p>
