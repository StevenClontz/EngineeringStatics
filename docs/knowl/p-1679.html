<p>Every shear and bending moment diagram problem should include:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>A neat, accurate, labeled free-body diagram of the entire structure, and the work to find the reactions. For this work, you may replace the distributed loads with equivalent concentrated loads.</li>
<li>A neat, properly scaled diagram of the beam showing its reactions and “true” loads.  Distributed loads must be shown this diagram, because their distributed nature is significant.</li>
<li>A large graph of the shear and bending moment functions drawn directly below the scaled beam diagram.  It is convenient to draw this graph on graph paper.</li>
<li>Show the correct shape and curvature for each curve segment: zero, constant slope, polynomial.  Changes in curve shapes should align with the load which causes them. Indicate the scale used for shear and moment, and use a straightedge.</li>
<li>Indicate values of shear and moment at maximums, minimums and points of inflection</li>
<li>Any other work need to justify your results.</li>
</ol>
