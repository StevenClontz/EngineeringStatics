<p>The initial steps to solve a truss are the same for both methods.  First, ensure that the structure can be modeled as a simple truss, then draw and label a sketch of the entire truss.  Each joint should be labeled with a letter, and the members will be identified by their endpoints, so member <span class="process-math">\(AB\)</span> is the member between joints <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span>  This will help you keep everything organized and consistent in later analysis. Then, treat the entire truss as a rigid body and solve for the external reactions using the methods of <a href="Chapter_05.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 5: Rigid Body Equilibrium">ChapterÂ 5</a>.  If the truss is cantilevered and unsupported at one end you may not actually need the reaction forces and may skip this step.  The reaction forces can be used later to check your work.</p>
