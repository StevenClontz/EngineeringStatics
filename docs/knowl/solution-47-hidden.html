<p>Rule 1:</p>

<li>Due to two members meeting at unloaded joint \(G\text{,}\) both members \(GH\) and \(FG\) are zero-force members</li>
<li>Due to two members meeting at unloaded joint \(D\text{,}\) both members \(DE\) and \(CD\) are zero-force members</li>

<p>Rule 2:</p>
<ul class="square">
<li>Due to three forces meeting at joining \(B\text{,}\) with two being collinear (internal forces in \(AB\) and \(BC\)) then \(BF\) is a zero-force member.</li>
<li>Due to three forces meeting at joint \(I\text{,}\) with two being collinear (internal forces \(IF\) and \(CI\)), then \(EI\) is a zero-force member. Note that member \(EI\) does not need to be perpendicular to the collinear members to be a zero force.</li>

Note that once \(EI\) and \(BF\) are eliminated, you can effectively eliminate the joints \(B\) and \(I\) as the member forces in the collinear members will be equal. Also notice that the truss is still formed of triangles which fully support all of the applied forces.</p></div>
