<p>The procedure for finding centroids with integration can be broken into three steps:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Set up the integrals.</span></span><p>Usually this is the hardest step.</p>
<p>You should always begin by drawing a sketch of the problem and reviewing the given information.</p>
<p>You will need to understand the boundaries of the shape, which may be lines or functions.  You may need to know some math facts, like the definition of slope, or the equation of a line or parabola.  A bounding function  may be given as a function of \(x\text{,}\) but you want it as a function of \(y,\) or vice-versa or it may have a constant which you will need to determine.</p>
<p>You will need to choose an element of area \(dA\text{.}\)  There are several choices available, including vertical strips, horizontal strips, or square elements; or in polar coordinates, rings, wedges or squares. There really is no right or wrong choice; they will all work, but one may make the integration easier than another. The best choice depends on the nature of the problem, and it takes some experience to predict which it will be.</p>

<figcaption xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">7.7.1<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>Differential Elements of Area</figcaption></figure><p>The two most common choices for differential elements are:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Square elements and double integrals.</span></span><p>If you choose an infinitesimal square element \(dA = dx\;dy\text{,}\) you must integrate twice, over \(x\) and over \(y\) between the appropriate integration limits.  The position of the element typically designated \((x,y)\text{.}\)</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Rectangular elements and single integrals.</span></span><p>If you choose rectangular strips you eliminate the need to integrate twice.  You may select a vertical element with a different width \(dx\text{,}\) and a height extending from the lower to the upper bound, or a horizontal strip with a differential height \(dy\) and a width extending from the left to the right boundaries.  Either way, you only integrate once to cover the enclosed area.</p>
<p>When finding the area enclosed by a single function \(y=f(x)\text{,}\) and the \(x\) and \(y\) axes \((x,y)\) represents a point on the function and  \(dA = y\ dx\) for vertical strips, or \(dA = x\ dy\) for horizontal strips.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You must find expressions for the area \(dA\) and centroid of the element \((\bar{x}_{\text{el}}, \bar{y}_{\text{el}})\) in terms of the bounding functions. This is how we turn an integral over an area into a definite integral which can be integrated.</p>
<p>When you have established  all these items, you can substitute them into <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/centroid_eqn.html" title="Equation 7.7.2">(7.7.2)</a> and proceed to the integration step.</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Solve the integrals.</span></span><p>This step is pure mathematics.</p>
<p>Here are some tips if you are doing integration “by hand”. Be neat,  work carefully, and check your work as you go along. Use proper mathematics notation: don't lose the differential \(dx\) or \(dy\) before the integration step, and don't include it afterwords.  Don't forget to use equals signs between steps.  Simplify as you go and don't substitute numbers or other constants too soon.  Pay attention to units: Area \(A\) should have units of \([\text{length}]^3\) and the first moments of area \(Q_x\) and \(Q_y\) should have units of \([\text{length}]^3\text{.}\) If your units aren't consistent, then you have made a mistake.</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Evaluate the centroid.</span></span><p>After you have evaluated the integrals you will have expressions or values for \(A\text{,}\) \(Q_x\text{,}\) and \(Q_y\text{.}\)  All that remains is to substitute these into the defining equations for \(\bar{x}\) and \(\bar{y}\) and simplify.  Notice the \(Q_x\) goes into the \(\bar{y}\) equation, and vice-versa.</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
\bar{x} \amp =  \frac{Q_y}{A} \amp \bar{y}\amp =  \frac{Q_x}{A}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>Finally, plot the centroid at \((\bar{x}, \bar{y})\) on your sketch and decide if your answer makes sense for area.</p>
