<p>Finding zero-force members is an iterative process. If you determine that a member is zero-force, eliminate it and you may find others. Continuing the analysis at joint <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> draw its free-body diagram.  Keep in mind that if one end of a member is zero-force the whole member is zero-force.  Since member <span class="process-math">\(BD\)</span> is zero-force, horizontal force <span class="process-math">\(BD\)</span> acting on joint <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> is zero and need not be included on the free-body diagram, and the remaining three forces match the conditions to apply Rule 2.</p>
