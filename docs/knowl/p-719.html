<p>The combined computation of the dot and cross product can either be done in two steps, or in a single step. Both techniques require three vectors which are:</p>
<ul class="square">
<li>
<em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">Unit vector along the line of interest:</em> If your line of interest is \(DE\text{,}\) then you will recall that a unit vector \(\hat{u}_{DE}\) is the pure direction of line \(DE\text{.}\)</li>
<li>
<em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">Position vector:</em> The position vector \(\vec{r}\) goes from any point along your line of interest to any point on the line of action of the force. Any one of the infinite vectors connecting the line of interest to the line of action will give you the same answer, but practically there are just a few which line up with the problem geometry</li>
<li>
<em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">Force vector:</em> This technique only allows you to find the moment for one force at a time. If you had multiple concurrent forces, you could find the resultant force first before taking the moment about the line of interest.</li>
</ul>
