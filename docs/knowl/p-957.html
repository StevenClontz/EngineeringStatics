<p>For example, look at the members and joints in the  truss below.  Diagram (a) shows the truss members held together by pins at \(A\text{,}\) \(B\text{,}\) and \(C\text{.}\)  The forces holding the parts together cancel and are not shown.  In the ‘exploded’ view (b), the parts have been separated and the action-reaction pairs are exposed.  Member \(AB\) is in tension, and the forces acting on it, also called \(AB\text{,}\) oppose each other and tend to stretch the member. These stretching forces are accompanied by equal and opposite forces, also called \(AB\) acting on pins \(A\) and \(B\text{.}\) Tensile forces \(BC\) and compressive forces \(CA\) behave similarly.</p>
