<p>As stated above, when working in three dimensions you actually need three angles to determine the direction of the vector, namely, the angle with respect to the \(x\) axis, the angle with respect to the \(y\) axis and the angle with respect to the \(z\) axis. The three angles mentioned above are not necessarily located in any of the coordinate planes.  Think of it this way — three points determine a plane, and in this case, the three points are: the origin, the tip of the vector, and a point on an axis.  The plane made by those three points is not necessarily the \(xy\text{,}\) \(yz\text{,}\) or \(xz\) plane.  It is most likely a “tilted” plane.</p>
