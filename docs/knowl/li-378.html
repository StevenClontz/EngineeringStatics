<p>Determining the bounding functions and setting up the integrals is usually the most difficult part of problems like this. Begin by drawing and labeling a sketch of the situation.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Place a point in the first quadrant and label it \(P=(a,b)\text{.}\) This point is in the first quadrant and fixed since we are told that \(a\) and \(b\) are positive integers</p></li>
<li><p>Place a horizontal line through \(P\) to make the upper bound.</p></li>
<li><p>Sketch in a parabola with a vertex at the origin and passing through \(P\) and shade in the enclosed area.</p></li>
<li><p>Decide which differential element you intend to use. For this example we choose to use vertical strips, which you can see if you tick  <code xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">show strips</code> in the interactive above.  Horizontal strips \(dA = x\ dy\) would give the same result, but you would need to define the equation for the parabola in terms of \(y\text{.}\)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Determining the equation of the parabola and expressing it in terms of of \(x\) and any known constants is a critical step.  You should remember from algebra that the general equation of parabola with a vertex at the origin is \(y = k x^2\text{,}\) where \(k\) is a constant which determines the shape of the parabola.  If \(k \gt 0\text{,}\) the parabola opens upward and if \(k \lt 0\text{,}\) the parabola opens downward.</p>
<p>To find the value of \(k\text{,}\) substitute the coordinates of \(P\) into the general equation, then solve for \(k\text{.}\)</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
y \amp = k x^2, \text{ so at } P \\
(b) \amp = k (a)^2\\
k \amp= \frac{b}{a^2}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>The resulting function of the parabola is</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
y = y(x) = \frac{b}{a^2} x^2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>To perform the integrations, express the area and centroidal coordinates of the element in terms of the points at the top and bottom of the strip.  The area of the strip is its height times its base, so</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
dA = (b-y)\ dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">If you incorrectly used \(dA =  y\ dx\text{,}\) you would find the centroid of the spandrel below the curve.</p>
<p>For vertical strips, the bottom is at \((x,y)\) on the parabola, and the top is directly above at \((x,b)\text{.}\)  The strip has a differential width \(dx\text{.}\) The centroid of the strip is located at its midpoint and the coordinates are are found by averaging the \(x\) and \(y\) coordinates of the points at the top and bottom.</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
\bar{x}_{\text{el}} \amp =  (x + x)/2 = x\\
\bar{y}_{\text{el}} \amp =  (y+b)/2
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>For vertical strips, the integrations are with respect to \(x\text{,}\) and the limits on the integrals are \(x=0\) on the left to \(x = a\) on the right.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="centroids-by-integration.html#li-378">in-context</a></span>
