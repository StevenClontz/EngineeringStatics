<p>To perform an equilibrium analysis, we need to develop one or more free body diagrams and apply the equations of equilibrium to them.  Free-body diagrams can be drawn for the entire structure, each individual part, and for any combination of connected parts.  Not all these diagrams will be needed however, and part of the challenge of solving these problems is selecting and drawing only the ones you need.  In any event, a clear decision must always be made about what is part of the free-body and what is not.</p>
