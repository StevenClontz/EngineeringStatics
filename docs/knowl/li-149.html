<p>In steps 6 and 7, Geogebra tells us that  <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">p = (0.438;10.0°)</code> which means force <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span>  is 0.438 units long with a direction of 10°, similarly  <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">n = (1.02;115°)</code> means <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> is 1.02 units long at 115°. These angles are measured counterclockwise from the positive <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> axis.</p>
<p>These are not the answers we are looking for, but we’re close.  Remember that for this diagram, our scale is</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
1 \text{ unit} = 100 \text{ lbs}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">so scaling the lengths of  <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">p</code> and  <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">n</code> by this factor gives</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{align*}
P   \amp =  (\unit{0.438}) (\lb{100}/\unit{})\\
\amp =  \lb{43.8}  \text{ at } 10° \measuredangle\\
N  \amp = ( \unit{1.02}) ({\lb{100}}/\unit{})\\
\amp =  \lb{102}  \text{ at } 115° \measuredangle\text{.}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>If you use technology such as Geogebra, as we did here, or CAD software to draw the force triangle, it will accurately produce the solution.</p>
<p>If technology isn't available to you, such as during an exam, you can still use a ruler and protractor draw the force triangle, but your results will only be as accurate as your diagram. In the best case, using a sharp pencil and carefully measuring lengths and angles, you can only expect about two significant digits of accuracy from an hand drawn triangle. Nevertheless, even a roughly drawn triangle can give you an idea of the correct answers and be used to check your work after you use another method to solve the problem.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="CH03-2d-particles.html#li-149" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
