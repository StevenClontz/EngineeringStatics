<em class="emphasis">Break vectors into components.</em> Compute each force’s x, y, and z components using the tools outlined in <a href="coordinates-3d.html" class="internal" title="Section 2.4: 3D Coordinate Systems &amp; Vectors">Section 2.4</a>. While the components in two-dimensional problems can often be found with right triangle trigonometry, three-dimensional problems often use unit vectors.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Write equilibrium equations.</em> Now represent your free-body diagram as equilibrium equations. For a three-dimensional particle equilibrium problem, you can have up to three force equilibrium equations corresponding to a force balance in the three independent x, y, and z directions. Each equation should start with the governing equation, like ΣF_x=0.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Count knowns and unknowns.</em> At this point, you should have at most three unknowns remaining. If you have over three, reread the problem and look for overlooked information.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Solve for unknowns.</em> Use algebra to simplify the equilibrium equations and solve for unknowns. With multiple unknowns scattered across multiple equations, linear algebra may be more efficient than substitution. Assume that all answers have units - unless you prove that they don’t. Finally, underline or box your answers.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Check your work.</em> If you add the components of the forces, do they add to zero? Do the results seem reasonable given the situation? Have you included appropriate units?</div></li>
