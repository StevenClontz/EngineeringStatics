<p>Up until this point in the course, the effects of friction forces have been considered negligible. The reality is that friction not only slows things down (like friction between your skis and the snow when you ski down a hill) but is also the force which causes motion (like the friction between the rear wheel of your bicycle and the road causing you to move forward when you pedal). This chapter introduces various types of friction that occur on blocks, wedges, screws, belts, bearings, and rotating discs.</p>
