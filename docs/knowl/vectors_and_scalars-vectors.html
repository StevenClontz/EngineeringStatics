<article class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Vectors.</span></h5>
<p><dfn class="terminology">Vectors</dfn> are physical quantities described by a magnitude and a direction. Examples of vectors we use in Statics include force vectors, position vectors, and moment (torsional) vectors. Computations involving vectors must always consider the directionality of each term and follow the rules of vector algebra.</p>
<p>Let us examine the terminology of a vector. Visualize a vector as an <dfn class="terminology">arrow</dfn>. The <dfn class="terminology">tip</dfn> is the pointed end and the <dfn class="terminology">tail</dfn> the trailing end. As vectors include direction, they operate along a <dfn class="terminology">line of action</dfn>. A line of action can be thought of as an invisible string along which a vector can slide. Sliding a vector along its line of action does not change the vector; thus, it can be a handy tool to simplify vector problems. Refer to the interactive diagram <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/vector_vocabularly.html" title="Figure 3.1">Figure 3.1</a> below.</p>
<p>The <dfn class="terminology">vector's magnitude</dfn> is a positive real number including units, and it describes the 'strength' or 'intensity' of the vector. Graphically we represent a vector's magnitude by the length of its vector arrow.  By itself, a vector's magnitude is a scalar quantity. It makes no sense to speak of a vector with a negative magnitude. Multiplying a vector by -1, produces a vector with the same magnitude but pointing in the opposite direction.   Later we will introduce <dfn class="terminology">scalar components</dfn> as a means of describing vectors.  These are scalar quantities which may be positive or negative which may lead to some confusion.</p>
<p>Vectors can either be either constant or vary as a function of time, position, or something else. For example, if a force varied with time according to the function \(F(t) = 10t\) [N] where \(t\) is the time in seconds, then the force would be 0 N at \(t=0\text{,}\) and increase by 10 N each second thereafter.</p>
<figure class="figure figure-like"><div style="width:600px;"><p id="p-7">Test your knowledge of how a vector can change by changing the (1) the magnitude of the vector using the slider, (2) the point of application of the vector by sliding the tail along the line of action, and (3) the direction of the vector by moving the direction of the line of action.</p></div>

<p>Vector directions are described in terms a <dfn class="terminology">coordinate system</dfn>. A coordinate system is an arbitrary reference system used to establish the origin, and the primary directions. You are familiar with the 'Cartesian' coordinate system with mutually perpendicular \(x\text{,}\) \(y\) and \(z\) axes and the origin at their intersection point.  Distances are usually measured from the origin, and directions from a primary direction.</p>
<p>One way of describing a vector's direction is to specify its <dfn class="terminology">orientation</dfn> and <dfn class="terminology">sense</dfn>.  Orientation is the angle the vector's line of action makes with a specified reference direction, and sense defines the direction the vector points along its line of action.   A weight vector has a vertical orientation 90° from the horizontal axis, with a downward sense.</p>
<p>Another way to represent the direction of a vector is with its <dfn class="terminology">unit vector</dfn>. A unit vector is a vector of length 1 which has the same  orientation and sense as a given vector. Hence, a unit vector is a pure direction, as it is independent of the magnitude and unit of measurement of the given vector. Unit vectors are discussed in more detail later in this chapter.</p>
<p>Notation is used to distinguish between scalars and vectors.  In printed work, vectors are rendered in a bold serif font (\(\vec{F})\) and rendered in an regular italic serif font (\(F\)).   When vectors are written by hand on the whiteboard or homework assignments a letter with an arrow above is the standard representation (\(\vecarrow{F}\)).</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="vectors_and_scalars.html#vectors_and_scalars-vectors">in-context</a></span>
