<section class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Three-dimensional Reactions.</span></h5>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The main added complexity with three-dimensional objects is that there are more possible ways the the object can move, and also more possible ways to restrain it. The table below show the types of supports which are available and the corresponding reaction forces and moment.  As before, your free-body digrams should show the reactions supplied by the constraints, not the constraints themselves.</p>

<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">A support which provides a non-zero reaction is said to be engaged. Picture a crate sitting at rest on a horizontal surface with a cable attached to the top of the crate.  If the cable is slack, the reaction of the cable would be available but not <em class="emphasis">engaged</em>. Instead, the floor would be supporting the full weight of the crate. If we were to remove the floor, the cable would be engaged and support the weight of the crate.</p>

Can you feel your hand supplying an upward force to support the weight <em class="emphasis">and</em> a counter-clockwise reaction couple to keep it horizontal?  Now add a similar support by gripping with your right hand. How do the forces and couple-moments change?  You should have felt the force of your left hand decrease as your right hand picked up half the weight, and also noticed that the reaction couple from your left hand was no longer needed.</p>

The reaction couples from both hands are available, but the vertical forces engage first and are sufficient for equilibrium. This phenomena is described by the saying “reaction forces engage before reaction couple-moments”.</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="Chapter_05-free-body-diagrams.html#paragraphs-57">in-context</a></span>
