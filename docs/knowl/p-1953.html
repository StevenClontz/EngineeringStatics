<div class="para">The friction force at any point of the contact area will equal the normal force at that point times the kinetic coefficient of friction at that point. If the coefficient of friction and the pressure between the collar and the surface is the same at all points, then the same friction force at every point is the same as well. This does not mean that the moment exerted at every point is equal as well. Elements along the outside edge of the contact area will cause a larger moment than those in the inside edge since they have larger moment arms.</div>
