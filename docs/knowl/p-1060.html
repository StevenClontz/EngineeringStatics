<p>The process used to analyze frames and machines is outlined below</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>
<p>Determine if the entire structure as independently rigid.  An independently rigid structure will hold it shape even when separated from its supports. Look for triangles formed among the members, as triangles are inherently rigid.  If it is not independently rigid, the structure will collapse when the supports are removed.</p>
<p>If the structure is not independently rigid, skip to the next step.  Otherwise, model it as a single rigid body and determine the external reaction forces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Draw a free-body diagram for each of the members in the structure. You must represent all forces acting on each member, including:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Applied forces and couples and the weights of the components if non-negligible.</p></li>
<li><p>Interaction forces due to two-force members.  There will be force of unknown magnitude but the known direction at  points connected to two-force members.  The forces will act along the line between the two connection points.</p></li>
<li><p>All reaction forces and couples at the connection points between members. Forces with an unknown magnitude and direction are usually represented by  unknown <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> components, but can also be represented as a force with unknown magnitude acting in an unknown direction.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All interaction forces and couples between connected bodies <em class="emphasis">must</em> be shown as equal-and-opposite action-reaction pairs.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Write out the equilibrium equations for each free-body diagram.</p></li>
<li><p>Solve the equilibrium equations for the unknowns. You can do this algebraically, solving for one variable at a time, or you can use matrix equations to solve for everything at once. Negative magnitudes indicate that the assumed direction of that term was incorrect, and the actual force/moment is opposite the assumed direction.</p></li>
