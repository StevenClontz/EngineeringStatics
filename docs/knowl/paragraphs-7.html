<article class="paragraphs"><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Statics is a course about forces and we will have a lot to say about them.  At its simplest, a force is a “push or pull”, but forces come from a variety of sources and occur in many different situations.  As such we need a specialized vocabulary to talk about them. We are also interested in forces that cause rotation, and we have special terms to describe these too.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">As an example of the types of forces you will encounter in statics consider the forces affecting a box on a rough surface being pulled by a cable. The loading on the box can be represented by four different forces. The cable causes a point force, the normal and friction forces are reaction forces, and the weight is a body force.</p>
