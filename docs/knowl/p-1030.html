<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The Method of Sections is a more targeted process than the Method of Joints, which is used to solve for the unknown forces within a limited number of members in a truss. The method involves cutting the truss into individual sections and analyzing each section as a separate rigid body. The advantage of the Method of Sections is that the only internal member forces exposed are those which you have cut through, the remaining internal forces are not exposed and thus ignored.</p>
