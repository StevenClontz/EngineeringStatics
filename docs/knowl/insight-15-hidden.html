<body class="ignore-math"><article class="insight remark-like"><p>To get a feel for how moment of inertia affects engineering design, find a ruler, a yardstick, or something similar: long with a rectangular cross section.</p>
<p>Try to bend the ruler both when it’s flat and also when it’s turned on edge. You will find that bending the ruler around the <span xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="process-math">\(x\)</span> axis while it’s flat is easy compared to bending it the other way, around the <span xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="process-math">\(z\)</span> axis . Why is it easier to bend the ruler one way than the other? It’s the same object, made of the same material either way.</p>
<p>The answer has to due with the moment of inertia, and how it relates to the bending axis.</p>

<p>For a <span xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="process-math">\(\inch{1/8}\)</span>  thick ruler that is <span xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="process-math">\(\inch{1}\)</span> tall, the bending resistance about the <span xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="process-math">\(z\)</span> axis is over 20 times more than the bending resistance the other way, about the <span xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="process-math">\(x\)</span> axis.</p>
<p>To further see how the moment of inertia comes into play, consider the curvature caused by applying opposing moments to the ends of a beam such as your ruler. You will cause it to bend into an arc of a circle of some radius.  A curious engineer would like to know how the curvature of the beam is related to the applied moment, the geometry, and the physical properties of the beam.</p>

<p>You will learn in Mechanics of Materials that the relationship is:</p>
<div xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation}
M=\theta \left (\frac{EI}{L} \right )\tag{10.1.4}
\end{equation}
</div>
<p class="continuation">where:</p>
<ul class="no-marker">
<li><p><span xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="process-math">\(E\)</span> is a material property called Young’s Modulus or the modulus of elasticity which characterizes the stiffness of a material.</p></li>
<li><p><span xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="process-math">\(L\)</span> is the length of the beam, and</p></li>
<li><p><span xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="process-math">\(I\)</span> is the moment of inertia of the cross-section of the beam about the bending axis.</p></li>
<li><p><span xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="process-math">\(M\)</span> is the moment applied to the ends of the beam, and</p></li>
<li><p><span xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="process-math">\(\theta\)</span> is the curvature of the beam.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="continuation">Since <span xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="process-math">\(E\)</span> and <span xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="process-math">\(I\)</span> are in the numerator and <span xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="process-math">\(L\)</span> is in the denominator, a longer beam is more flexible and larger values of <span xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="process-math">\(E\)</span> or <span xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="process-math">\(I\)</span> make the beam stiffer.  With those properties fixed, angle <span xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="process-math">\(\theta\)</span> is directly proportional to the moment <span xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="process-math">\(M\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>The sag, or <dfn xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="terminology">deflection</dfn>, of a beam when supporting a load is also related to these factors, and the placement of the load as well.
