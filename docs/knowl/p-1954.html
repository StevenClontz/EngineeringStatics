<em class="alert">Unwind-with-load screw</em><span class="process-math">\((\phi_\text{s} \lt \alpha)\)</span> - As its name implies, an unwind-under-load screw will start turning unless a moment <span class="process-math">\(M’’\)</span> is applied to keep the screw at (or beyond) impending motion. Note that the moment to push a self-locking screw to impending motion <span class="process-math">\(M’\)</span> is in the opposite direction as the moment to keep unwind-under-load screws at impending motion <span class="process-math">\(M’’\text{,}\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(M’’\)</span> is in the same direction as the moment to loosen (or raise) a screw. These unwind-with-load screws are not often found in mechanical systems, except for in dynamic motion control systems, where the screw is used to slow down motion. To be designed in an unwind-with-load condition, a screw must have a quite steep thread angle <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span> and minimal friction between the threads and nut, which reduces <span class="process-math">\(\phi_\text{s}\text{.}\)</span>
