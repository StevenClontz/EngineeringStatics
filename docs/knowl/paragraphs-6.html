<article class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Body Forces.</span></h5>
<p>Body forces are forces that are distributed throughout a three dimensional body.</p>
<p>The most important body force is the weight of an object, but other body forces include buoyancy and forces caused by gravitational, electric, and magnetic fields.</p>
<p>Weight and buoyancy will be the only body forces we consider in Statics. In many situations, these forces are small in comparison to the loads acting on the object, and as such, they may be neglected.  The decision to neglect forces must be made on the basis of sound engineering judgment, however in this course, you should consider the weight in your analysis if a problem statement provides enough information to determine the force, otherwise, you may ignore it.</p>
<p>Remember that mass = density times volume.</p>

m \amp = \rho V \amp (\text{Constant density})\tag{2.3}
\end{align}
</div>
<p>As shown in <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">[provisional cross-reference: Chapter_07]</code>, for computational simplicity we often model a bodyâ€™s weight as a single equivalent point force acting through the center of mass of the body.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="Chapter_01-forces.html#paragraphs-6">in-context</a></span>
