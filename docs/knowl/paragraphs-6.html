<article class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Cartesian Unit Vectors.</span></h5>
<p>Another way to express the directions of the \(x\text{,}\) \(y\text{,}\) and \(z\) axes are with unit vectors.  A unit vector is a vector with a magnitude of one, and no units.  As such, a unit vector represents a pure direction.  It's a vector that points in a certain direction.  By convention a unit vector is indicated by a 'hat' over a vector symbol.  Because they occur frequently, the unit vectors in each of the three Cartesian coordinate directions are their own symbol, which are:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>The unit vector pointing in the \(x\) direction is \(\ihat\text{,}\)</li>
<li>The unit vector pointing in the \(y\) direction is \(\jhat\text{,}\) and</li>
<li>The unit vector pointing in the \(z\) direction is \(\khat\text{.}\)</li>
</ul>
<p>If a unit vector is multiplied by a scalar value, the vector is 'scaled' by that amount, so for instance if \(\ihat\) is multiplied by  \(\N{ 100}\) the result is a \(\N{100}\) vector pointing to the right, if \(\jhat\) is multiplied by  \(\N{ -50}\) the result is a \(\N{50}\) vector pointing down.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="Orthogonal_Coordinates-orthogonal-vector-components.html#paragraphs-6">in-context</a></span>
