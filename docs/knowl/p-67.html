<p>Using triangle-based geometry to solve vector problems can be a quick and powerful tool, but includes the following limitations:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>There are only three sides in a triangle; thus graphical addition is limited to two vectors (and the resultant). You could still draw graphical shapes with three or more vectors to be added but then the shapes become complex polygons.</li>
<li>If you fail to draw the correct vector triangle, you will not find the correct answer.</li>
<li>The trigonometric functions in Table dd above, are all scalar functions. Thus, they are quick ways of solving for the magnitudes of vectors and the angle between vectors, but you would need to complete more analysis if you were asked to find the vector components of an angle from a given datum.</li>
</ul>
