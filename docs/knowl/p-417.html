<p>The controlling design parameter for most engineering systems is deformation. Thankfully, due to a property called elasticity, most materials will bend, stretch, and compress, long before they ultimately break. For example, when designing the floor in a new building, the floor is often limited to deflecting less than the length of the span in inches, divided by 360. Any more deformation than this would be considered disconcerting to the building residents and also start damaging surface materials (like drywall). For example, for a \(\ft{20}\) span, the deflection would need to be less than</p>
