<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Assume you have a hammer and a screwdriver in your toolbox. Learning how to hammer in a nail or drive in a screw is analogous to the type of skills you will learn in each section of this book. But, knowing <em class="emphasis">which</em> tool is most appropriate to use only comes after you master the operation of each tool. Thus, if your task is to sink a nail into a block of wood, you likely find that the screwdriver is not the most efficient tool for the job. In your life, you have already learned to select problem-solving tools for a wide array of challenges - from cleaning your dishes to getting to the grocery store.</p>
