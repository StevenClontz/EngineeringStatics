<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Once you have your \(\Sigma\vec{F}=0\) and \(\Sigma\vec{M}_o=0\) equations in each of your \(x\text{,}\) \(y\text{,}\) and \(z\) directions set up, you could be facing up to six equations and six unknown values. Nearly all equation sets are solvable with substitution, but it can often be easier to solve these large equation sets with linear algebra. Note that the adjective “linear” specifies that your unknown values must be linear terms, which means that each unknown variable cannot be raised to a exponent, be an exponent, or buried inside of a \(sine\) or \(cosine\) function. Luckily, most unknowns in equilibrium are linear terms, except for unknown angles. If you are not familiar with the use of linear algebra matrices to simultaneously solve equations, search the internet for <em class="emphasis">Solving Systems of Equations Using Linear Algebra</em> and you will find plenty of resources.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">No matter how you choose to solve for the unknown values, any numeric values which come out to be negative reveal that your initial hypothesis of that vector’s direction was incorrect.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="Chapter_05-three-dimensional-equilibrium.html#paragraphs-65">in-context</a></span>
