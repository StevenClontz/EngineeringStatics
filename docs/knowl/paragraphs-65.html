<article class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Non-engaged Reaction Couples.</span></h5>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">One new issue we have to face in three-dimensional problems is that some reaction couples are available but not engaged. Before we get into the details for reaction couples, let us discuss what we mean by the word <em class="emphasis">engaged</em>. Picture a crate sitting at rest on a horizontal surface. If you were to attach a cable to the top of the crate, but not pull on the cable, the tension in the cable would be available but not <em class="emphasis">engaged</em> in this condition. Instead, the floor’s normal force would be supporting the full weight of the crate without need of the tension force in the cable. If we were to remove the floor under the crate, then the cable’s tension force would be engaged to support the weight of the crate.</p>

<ul class="square">
<li>Find a rigid object around 1 to 3 feet long that you can pick up with one hand. An umbrella, baseball bat, or even a textbook would work.</li>
<li>Grip the object on one end with one hand. Describe the type of forces and couple-moments you feel in your hand. What would a free-body diagram of the object look like?</li>
<li>Now grip the object with two hands on either end of the object. How did the forces and couple-moments change from when you were holding with one hand?</li>
</ul>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">You should have discovered that the vertical force from each of your two hands was half of the vertical force required with one hand. But hopefully, you noticed something more than a change in force magnitude. When holding the object with one hand, did you feel that your hand needed to provide a resistance to the rotation of the object? When you grabbed the other side with your second hand, this resistance to rotation was no longer needed. The phenomena that you (hopefully) just discovered can be described by the saying “reaction forces engage before reaction couple-moments”. Essentially, the vertical force in your second hand engaged instead of the couple-moment resistance in your first hand. The reaction couple-moments from both hands are technically both available, but the vertical forces from the other hand engage first, as seen in the XREF Figure below.</p>
