<p>The general procedure for solving equilibrium of a particle (or concurrent force) problems in three dimensions is essentially the same as for two dimensions using the components method.  The major differences are that you must be very careful about the orientation and direction of each axis of the coordinate frame and the angles each vector makes with each axis.  When working in three dimensions there are three important angles, but the general procedure is the same.  The overall procedure is presented here and then each of the new steps is explained in more detail.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p><em class="emphasis">Identify the particle.</em> The particle will be the object or point where the lines of action of all the forces intersect.</p></li>
<li><p><em class="emphasis">Establish a coordinate system.</em> Normally this will be a system with the origin at the particle or directly below the particle, a horizontal <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> axis, a vertical <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> axis, and the <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> axis coming out of the page and towards you.  It is important to follow the right-hand rule when defining the coordinate system.</p></li>
<li><p><em class="emphasis">Draw a free-body diagram.</em> The <abbr class="acronym">FBD</abbr> shows the object and all the forces acting on it, and defines the symbols we will use.  Every force should be labeled with a roman letter to represent its magnitude. Appropriate angles should be represented by a greek letter  with a subscript indicating which axis the angle of the vector is measured against.</p></li>
<li><p><em class="emphasis">State any given values</em> and identify the unknown values.</p></li>
<li><p><em class="emphasis">Determine the direction of each of the force vectors.</em> Angles are usually determined by the geometry.</p></li>
<li><p><em class="emphasis">Count knowns and unknowns.</em> At this point you should have no more than three unknowns remaining. If you don't, reread the problem and look for overlooked information. When solving mechanics problems, it is always helpful to know what you know and what you are looking for and this information changes as you work through your solution.</p></li>
<li><p><em class="emphasis">Formulate equilibrium equations.</em> Based on the free-body diagram and using the symbols you have selected, formulate the three equilibrium equations.</p></li>
<li><p><em class="emphasis">Simplify.</em> Use algebra to simplify the equilibrium equations. Get them into a form where the unknown values are alone on the left of the equals sign. Work symbolically as long as you can and avoid the temptation to insert numeric values prematurely, because this tends to lead to errors and obscures the relationships between the forces and angles.</p></li>
<li><p><em class="emphasis">Substitute values for symbols.</em> When your equilibrium equations have been fully simplified in symbolic form, pull out your calculator and substitute the known values and calculate the unknowns. Indicate the units of your results, and underline or box your answers.</p></li>
<li><p><em class="emphasis">Check your work.</em> Have you made any algebra or trig mistakes? If you add the components of the forces, do they add to zero? Do the results seem reasonable given the situation? Have you included appropriate units?</p></li>
