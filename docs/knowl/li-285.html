<p>Identify a solvable joint and solve it using the methods of <a href="Chapter_03.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 3: Equilibrium of Particles">ChapterÂ 3</a>. When drawing free-body diagrams of joints you should</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Represent the joint as a dot.</p></li>
<li><p>Draw all known forces in their known directions with arrowheads indicating their sense.  Known forces are the given loads, and forces determined from previously solved joints.</p></li>
<li><p>Assume the sense of unknown forces. A common practice is to assume that all unknown forces are in tension, i.e. pulling away from the free-body diagram of the pin,  and label them based on the member they represent .</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, write out and solve the force equilibrium equations for  the joint. If you assumed that all forces were tensile earlier, negative answers indicate compression.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="method-of-joints.html#li-285" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
