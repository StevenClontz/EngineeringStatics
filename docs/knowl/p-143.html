<p>You must be careful here and use some common sense.  The \(\ang{-30}\) angle your calculator gives you in this problem is incorrect because point \(P\) is in the second quadrant, but your calculator doesn't know this.    It can't tell whether the argument of  \(\tan^{-1}(-0.577)\) is negative because the  \(x\) was negative or because the \(y\) was negative, so it must make an assumption and in this case it is wrong.</p>
