<p>Tables:</p>
<p>I think that tables should be used to summarize information explained in the text.  I have converted most to linear presentation with a list</p>
<p>Geogebra applets will need to be modified somewhat to look good on the page.  Font sizes, aspect ratios, pan and zoom, colors.  All need to be thought about.</p>
<p>It is a struggle to make geogebra applets fit in the width available.  Requires a lot of trial and error.  I will probably learn best way to do it eventually</p>
<p>I need to adjust the nesting levels TOC max depth is 3.</p>
<p>Chapter</p>
<p>- Section</p>
<p>--   Subsection</p>
<p>---     Subsubsection</p>
<p>para or p</p>
<p>Probably should spell out most instances of 1D, 2D and 3D   three dimensional?</p>
<p>Grammar says numbers less than 10 should be spelled out: one, not 1</p>
<p>3D coordinate systems:</p>
<p>I have a lot of problems with this section.</p>
<p>should all be mentioned together as orthogonal systems.  Don't downplay cylindrical systems,  Mention that they are used to specify a point in space as well as used for vectors.  Diagram shows angle theta measured the wrong way. I believe that polar and spherical are not synonymous.  Polar coordinates are the r-theta system used in 2d.</p>
<p>I am not sure how effective hypothes.is will be while the source document continues to change.  Will need to test this out.</p>
<p>I believe that the student survey about textbooks wanted lots of example problems.  There are none in this chapter yet.</p>
<p>Need to figure out how to turn off figures/interactives in knowls.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what I think of dan's step-by-step process approach.</p>
<p>Example was difficult to typeset, but I think better than Dan's presentation as a table, which btw wouldn't be any easier to typset.  The solution or problem statement needs a diagram.  I want each step of the solution to begin with a well-known symbolic equation.</p>
<p>Fixed processing chain to retain quantities and remix elements in source.</p>
<p>Simplify example structure in chapter 3</p>
<p>Interactive 'instructions' render above the diagram, but it should be possible to change this in the stylesheets.</p>
<p>I can't figure out how to make xrefs go to the referenced element instead of in a knowl, but should be possible.</p>
<p>In the formulas involving projections 'proj' is rendering in italics.  I have defined a projection operator \proj  which renders it as roman, but I still don't like the notation.  Is there another notation Proj_{b/a}?  proj_b^a?  Need to work on this.</p>
<p>Spell out and hyphenate three-dimensional but three dimensions, etc.  Avoid 3D</p>
<p>The notation section needs some work.  I do almost a whole lecture on just this.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="backmatter-chapter-notes.html#paragraphs-42">in-context</a></span>
