<p>Engineering Statics (hereafter shortened to Statics) is the gateway course into the rest of engineering mechanics, which is the application of Newtonian physics to design and analyze objects, systems, and structures with respect to motion, deformation, and/or failure. One of the main ways you will develop skills and knowledge in the area of mechanics is through the practice of solving problems.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="Chapter_01-introduction.html#paragraphs-1">in-context</a></span>
