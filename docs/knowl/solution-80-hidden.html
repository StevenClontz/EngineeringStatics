<body><div class="solution solution-like"><p>Although the areas of all three triangles are the same, triangle \(B\) has the area on both sides of the \(y\) axis and relatively close to it, and so has the smallest \(I\text{,}\) while triangle \(C\) has the most of its area far from the \(y\) axis which makes its moment of inertia largest.  We will be able to show later that the \(I_C = 3 I_A = 9 I_B\text{.}\)</p></div></body>
