<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Identifying and analyzing two-force members will be very helpful when solving structures. Recall from <a href="CH03-1d-particles.html#two-force-bodies" class="internal" title="Subsection 3.3.3: Two-force Bodies">SubsectionÂ 3.3.3</a> that a two-force body is an object subjected to exactly two forces. Two-force members are not required to be slender or straight, but usually can be recognized because they connect to other bodies or supports with two frictionless pins, and have no other loading unless it is applied at the pins.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">In order for a two-force body to be in equilibrium, the forces must be 1) equal in magnitude, 2) opposite in direction, and 3) share the same line of action.  If the two forces tend to stretch the object we say it is in <em class="emphasis">tension</em>.  If they act the other way and squash the object, it is called <em class="emphasis">compression</em>.</p>

<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The common way to express an axial force in a two-force member is with a magnitude and a sense, where the sense is either tension or compression. For example, look at the members and joints of a truss below.  Member \(AB\) is in tension, and the forces acting on it, also called \(AB\text{,}\) oppose each other and tend to stretch the member. These stretching forces are accompanied by equal and opposite forces, also called \(AB\) acting on pins \(A\) and \(B\text{.}\)</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The free-body diagrams of the members can only verify that the forces on members are equal and opposite.  The free-body diagrams of the joints are required to relate the forces in the members to the external reaction and applied forces.</p>
