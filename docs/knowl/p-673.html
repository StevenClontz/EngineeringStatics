<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">When working with moments, it is important to remember that moments are vectors. That is, they have both a magnitude and a direction. As such, they obey all rules of vector addition and subtraction described in Chapter 2 Forces and Other Vectors. They also have a point of application, although it is more accurate to say that moments have an axis of rotation. In two dimensions, moments will rotate about the axis perpendicular to the two-dimensional plane (hence the axis will be perpendicular to the screen/page) and so will appear to act around a point. In three dimensions, the axis of rotation can be going in any direction.</p>
