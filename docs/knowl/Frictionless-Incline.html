<div class="introduction">
<p>In this example we will use technology to draw a scaled diagram of the force triangle representing the equilibrium situation.  We are using <a class="external" href="https://geogebra.org" target="_blank">Geogebra</a> to make the drawing, but you could use CAD, another drawing program, or even a ruler and protractor as you prefer.</p>
<p>Since the diagram is accurately drawn the lengths and angles represent the the magnitudes and directions of the forces which hold the particle in equilibrium.</p>

<p>If you use technology such as Geogebra, as we did here, or CAD software to draw the force triangle, it will accurately produce the solution.</p>
<p>If technology isn't available to you, such as during an exam, you can still use a ruler and protractor draw the force triangle, but your results will only be as accurate as your diagram.  In the best case, using a sharp pencil and carefully measuring lengths and angles, you can only expect about two significant digits of accuracy from an hand drawn triangle.  Nevertheless, even a roughly drawn triangle can give you an idea of the correct answers and be used to check your work after you use another method to solve the problem.</p>
