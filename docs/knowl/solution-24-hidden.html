<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">We must assume that the block is in equilibrium, that is, either motionless or moving at a constant velocity in order to use the equilibrium equations.  We will represent the block’s weight and the force between the incline and the block as concentrated forces.  The force of the inclined surface on the block must act in a direction which is normal to the surface since it is frictionless and can't prevent motion along the surface.</p></article><article class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Givens.</span></h5>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The knowns here are the weight of the block, the direction of the applied force, and the slope of the incline.  The slope of the incline provides the direction of the normal force.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The unknown values are the magnitudes of forces \(P\) and \(N\text{.}\)</p></article><article class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Free Body Diagram.</span></h5>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">You should always begin a statics problem by drawing a free-body diagram.  It gives you an opportunity to think about the situation, identify knowns and unknowns, and define symbols.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">We define three symbols, \(W\text{,}\) \(N\text{,}\) and \(P\text{,}\) representing the weight, normal force, and the applied force respectively.  The angles could be given symbols too, but since we know their values it isn't necessary.</p>

<ol class="decimal">
<li>Start by placing point \(A\) at the origin.</li>
<li>Draw force \(\vec{W}\) straight down from \(A\) with a length of 1, and place point \(B\) at its tip.  The length of this vector represents the weight.</li>
<li>We know the direction of force \(\vec{P}\) but not its magnitude.  For now, just draw line \(BC\) passing through point \(B\) with an angle of 10° from the horizontal.</li>
<li>Similarly we know force \(\vec{N}\) acts at 25° from vertical because it is perpendicular to the inclined surface, and it will close the triangle. So draw line \(CA\) passing through point \(A\) and at a 25° angle from the \(y\) axis.</li>
<li>Call the point where lines \(BC\) and \(CA\) intersect point \(C\text{.}\)  Points \(A\text{,}\) \(B\text{,}\) and \(C\) define the force triangle.</li>
<li>Now  draw force \(\vec{P}\) from point \(B\) to point \(C\text{,}\) and</li>
<li>Draw force \(\vec{N}\) from point \(C\) back to point \(A\text{.}\)</li>

<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">In steps 6 and 7, Geogebra tells us that  <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">p = (0.438;10.0°)</code> which means force \(P\)  is 0.438 units long with a direction of 10°, similarly  <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">n = (1.02;115°)</code> means \(N\) is 1.02 units long at 115°. These angles are measured counterclockwise from the positive \(x\) axis.</p>
<p>These are not the answers we are looking for, but we’re close.  Remember that for this diagram, our scale is</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
1 \text{ unit} = 100 \text{ lbs}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">so scaling the lengths of  <code xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">p</code> and  <code xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">n</code> by this factor gives</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
P   \amp =  (\unit{0.438}) (\lb{100}/\unit{})\\
\amp =  \lb{43.8}  \text{ at } 10° \measuredangle\\
N  \amp = ( \unit{1.02}) ({\lb{100}}/\unit{})\\

<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">If you use technology such as Geogebra, as we did here, or CAD software to draw the force triangle, it will accurately produce the solution.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">If technology isn't available to you, such as during an exam, you can still use a ruler and protractor draw the force triangle, but your results will only be as accurate as your diagram. In the best case, using a sharp pencil and carefully measuring lengths and angles, you can only expect about two significant digits of accuracy from an hand drawn triangle. Nevertheless, even a roughly drawn triangle can give you an idea of the correct answers and be used to check your work after you use another method to solve the problem.</p></article>
