<p>In this problem, the knowns are the magnitude and direction of force \(\vec{B}\) and moment \(\vec{C}\) and the dimensions of the beam.</p>
<p>The constraints are the frictionless pin at \(A\) and the rocker at \(D\text{.}\)  The pin prevents translation but not rotation, which means two it has two unknowns, represented by either magnitude and direction, or by two orthogonal components.  The rocker provides a force perpendicular to the surface it rests on, which is \(\ang{30}\) from the horizontal.  This means that the line of action of force  \(\vec{D}\) is \(\ang{30}\) from the vertical, giving us its direction but not its sense or magnitude</p>

<p>Add forces \(A_x\) and \(A_y\) representing vector \(\vec{A}\) and force \(\vec{D}\) at \(D\text{,}\) acting \(\ang{30}\) from the vertical.</p>
<p>When a force has a known line of action as with force \(\vec{D}\text{,}\) draw it acting along that line; donâ€™t break it into components.  When it is not obvious which way a reaction force actually points along its lines of action, just make your best guess and place an arrowhead accordingly.  Your calculations will confirm or refute your guess later.</p>
<div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:0%;margin-right:0%;">
<div class="sbspanel top" style="width:48%;"><p>As in the previous example, you could alternately represent force \(\vec{A}\) as an unknown magnitude acting in an unknown direction, though there is no particular advantage to doing so in this case.</p></div>
