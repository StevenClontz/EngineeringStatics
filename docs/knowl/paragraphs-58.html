<article class="paragraphs"><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Many equilibrium problems <em class="emphasis">cannot</em> be solved by the methods we are now learning, and it is fruitless to try. This section will help you learn how to separate the solvable problems from the unsolvable ones<a class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-4-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.6.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">A body in equilibrium is held stable by supports that both counteract the applied loads and also restrict the body’s motion. The number and orientation of the support components determine if a rigid body is <em class="emphasis">stable</em> or <em class="emphasis">unstable</em>. You have also learned to represent supports with reaction forces and couple-moments on a free-body diagram and to create equations from a free-body diagram to solve for the unknown terms. Having enough information in these equations to mathematically solve a statics problem determines if the problem is either <em class="emphasis">determinate</em> or <em class="emphasis">indeterminate</em>. All problems in statics need to be determinate and stable. In subsequent courses, you will learn additional tools/equations to evaluate more complicated systems. The next two sections drill down into these terms a bit deeper.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="Chapter_05-stability-and-determinacy.html#paragraphs-58">in-context</a></span>
