<div class="para">Friction is a force which resists any relative motion between surfaces in contact with each other. To this point we have only discussed cases where the friction could be safely ignored or had no impact on the situation, however there are many interesting situations in statics including impending motion, wedges, screws, belts, bearings, and rotating disks where friction must be taken into account. These are the subject of this chapter.</div>
