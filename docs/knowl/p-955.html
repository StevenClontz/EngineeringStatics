<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Load paths can help you think about structural systems. Load paths show conceptually how an applied load like the floor load in the image below passes through the interconnected members of a structure until it ends up at the fixed support reaction. All structural systems, whether non-moving frames or moving machines have some sort of load path. This is also a good concept to think about while problem solving, where you need to computationally move from known values through the interconnected bodies of the system, solving for unknowns as you go.</p>
