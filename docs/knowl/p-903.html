<p>Now lets refocus our discussion on reaction couples and talk through a quick experiment that you can do.</p>
<ul class="square">
<li>Find a rigid object around 1 to 3 feet long that you can pick up with one hand. An umbrella, baseball bat, or even a textbook would work.</li>
<li>Grip the object on one end with one hand. Describe the type of forces and couple-moments you feel in your hand. What would a free-body diagram of the object look like?</li>
<li>Now grip the object with two hands on either end of the object. How did the forces and couple-moments change from when you were holding with one hand?</li>
</ul>
