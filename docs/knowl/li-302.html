<p>Next draw a free-body diagram for each of the members in the structure. You will need to include all forces acting on each member, including:</p>
<ul class="square">
<li>All applied forces/couples that may be acting at the members.</li>
<li>Interaction forces from two-force members. Recall, at connection points with two-force members there will be single force of unknown magnitude but the known direction (the forces will act along the line between the two connection points on the member).</li>
<li>Next, add in the remaining reaction forces/couples at the connection points between members. For forces with an unknown magnitude and direction (such as in pin joints) the forces are often drawn in as having unknown x and y components.</li>
</ul>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Remember that the interaction forces/couples between connected bodies will be equal and opposite.</p>
