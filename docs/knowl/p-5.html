<p>The <dfn class="terminology">vector's magnitude</dfn> is a positive real number including units, and it describes the 'strength' or 'intensity' of the vector. Graphically we represent a vector's magnitude by the length of its vector arrow.  By itself, a vector's magnitude is a scalar quantity. It makes no sense to speak of a vector with a negative magnitude. Multiplying a vector by -1, produces a vector with the same magnitude but pointing in the opposite direction.   Later we will introduce <dfn class="terminology">scalar components</dfn> as a means of describing vectors.  These are scalar quantities which may be positive or negative which may lead to some confusion.</p>
