<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The common way to express an axial force in a two-force member is with a magnitude and a sense, where the sense is either tension or compression. For example, look at the members and joints of a truss below.  Member \(AB\) is in tension, and the forces acting on it, also called \(AB\text{,}\) oppose each other and tend to stretch the member. These stretching forces are accompanied by equal and opposite forces, also called \(AB\) acting on pins \(A\) and \(B\text{.}\)</p>
