<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Statics is a course about forces and we will have a lot to say about them.  At its simplest, a force is a 'push or pull', but forces come from a variety of sources and occur in many different situations.  As such we need a specialized vocabulary to talk about them. One example of defining forces can be found below in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/block_forces.html" title="Figure 1.6">FigureÂ 1.6</a>. We are also interested in forces that cause rotation, and we have special terms to describe these too.</p>
