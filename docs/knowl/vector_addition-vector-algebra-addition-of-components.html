<p>Recall that previously in Orthogonal Components, we discussed expressing a single vector as the sum of their components. It turns out that if you want the resultant of multiple vectors, they too can be split into components and then added using vector algebra to find the resultant. The steps are as follows:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>Select a coordinate system</li>
<li>Compute each vector's components using the selected coordinate system</li>
<li>Add together the similar components to find the components of the resultant</li>
<li>Bring the components of the resultant together to express and/or draw your resultant.</li>
</ol>
<p>The use of vector algebra is highly robust. When you are only adding two vectors, Graphical Vector Addition can be more time-efficient.  However, the algebraic addition of components finds the resultant of any number of vectors.</p>
<p>The interactive diagram in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/addition-2d-views.html" title="Figure 2.8">FigureÂ 2.8</a>  demonstrates this method. When you move the slider to the  <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Rectangular Components</code> position you will forces  \(\vec{A}\) and \(\vec{B}\) resolved into components, which are then added together to find the components of the resultant force \(\vec{R}\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="vector_addition.html#vector_addition-vector-algebra-addition-of-components">in-context</a></span>
