<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Varignon’s Theorem is a mathematical simplification of taking cross products developed by French mathematician Pierre Varignon (1654 – 1722) which was published in 1687. It states that the sum of the moments of multiple concurrent forces (which all act through one point) is equal to the moment of the resultant of those forces. In other words, to find the moment of a series of concurrent forces about a given point, we can sum the forces first to find the resultant and then calculate the moment of that resultant about the point of interest, or compute the moment of each individual force about the point of interest and then sum those moments to find the net moment about that point.</p>
