<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">You should have discovered that the vertical force from each of your two hands was half of the vertical force required with one hand. But hopefully, you noticed something more than a change in force magnitude. When holding the object with one hand, did you feel that your hand needed to provide a resistance to the rotation of the object? When you grabbed the other side with your second hand, this resistance to rotation was no longer needed. The phenomena that you (hopefully) just discovered can be described by the saying “reaction forces engage before reaction couple-moments”. Essentially, the vertical force in your second hand engaged instead of the couple-moment resistance in your first hand. The reaction couple-moments from both hands are technically both available, but the vertical forces from the other hand engage first, as seen in the XREF Figure below.</p>
