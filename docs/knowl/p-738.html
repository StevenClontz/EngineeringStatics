<p>The key added challenge of solving wedge problems is that the angled faces of wedges create additional force components in your equations. One of the critical steps to solve a block or wedge problem is to look at the problem statement and drawing to determine which force is engaging the friction of the system. Start by drawing the friction forces on the body where this force acts (see <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/wedge_EE.html" title="Figure 5.8">FigureÂ 5.8</a>). As you are passing the friction and normal forces to adjacent <abbr class="acronym">FBDs</abbr>, do not forget to draw both friction and normal forces in the opposite direction.</p>
