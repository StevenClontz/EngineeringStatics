<article class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Graphical Vector Addition.</span></h5>
<p>There are two ways to graphically add vectors: the Triangle Rule and Parallelogram Rule. Note that in this section we focus on problems where just two vectors are summed to find their resultant. When you need to find the resultant of more than two vectors, it is typically best to use the Algebraic Addition of Components below.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>For the Triangle Rule, place the tail of one vector at the tip of the other vector, then draw the resultant from the first vector's tail to the final vector's tip.</li>
<li>Next for the Parallelogram Rule, you line up the tails of both vectors, then complete a parallelogram with extension lines parallel to each vector. The resultant is equal to the diagonal from the tails to the opposite corner.</li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to the interactive in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/addition-2d-views.html" title="Figure 2.8">Figure 2.8</a>. This interactive allows you to adjust the directions of both the \(5~\text{ lb} \) and  \(10~\text{ lb} \) tension forces acting on the eye bolt and see how the triangle rule and parallelogram rule both give you the same resultant force \(\vec{R}\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Once you draw your triangle or parallelogram, then you can use various tools from trigonometry to solve for the unknown sides or angles. The triangle definitions can be viewed in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/triangle_definitions.html" title="Figure 2.9">Figure 2.9</a> and the trigonometric tools for triangles you need are found in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/trig_tools.html" title="Table 2.10: Trigonometric tools for solving vector triangles and parallelograms">Table 2.10</a> below.</p>

</table></figure><p>Using triangle-based geometry to solve vector problems can be a quick and powerful tool, but includes the following limitations:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>There are only three sides in a triangle; thus graphical addition is limited to two vectors (and the resultant). You could still draw graphical shapes with three or more vectors to be added but then the shapes become complex polygons.</li>
<li>If you fail to draw the correct vector triangle, you will not find the correct answer.</li>
<li>The trigonometric functions in Table dd above, are all scalar functions. Thus, they are quick ways of solving for the magnitudes of vectors and the angle between vectors, but you would need to complete more analysis if you were asked to find the vector components of an angle from a given datum.</li>
</ul>
<p>If any of these limitations apply to the problem you are trying to solve, never fear, just move onto the next section where you will learn to perform the Algebraic Addition of Components.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="vector_addition.html#vector_addition-graphical-vector-addition">in-context</a></span>
