<p>If you choose this typical set of equations, you have two decisions to make to help decrease the amount of math you need to solve for the unknowns. First, choose an axis system. To decrease the number of terms in the \(\Sigma \vec{F}_x\) and \(\Sigma \vec{F}_y\) equations, pick an axis system that lines up with as many unknown force vectors as possible. Second, you can sum moments around any point on or off the body, so try to select:</p>
<ul class="square">
<li>a point at the intersection of as many force lines-of-action as possible, and</li>
<li>a point which minimizes the number of unknowns in your moment equation.</li>
</ul>
