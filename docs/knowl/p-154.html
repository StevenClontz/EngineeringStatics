<p>One common way to define the direction of a three-dimensional vector is by using <dfn class="terminology">direction cosine angles</dfn>, also commonly known as <dfn class="terminology">coordinate direction angles</dfn>. The direction cosine angles are the three angle between the positive \(x\text{,}\) \(y\text{,}\) and \(z\) axes to a given vector and are called \(\theta_x\text{,}\) \(\theta_y\text{,}\) and \(\theta_z\text{,}\) respectively.   Three dimensional vectors, components, and angle are difficult to visualize.  The interactive shown in figure should help you develop your visualization skills, which will be helpful to have when solving problems.</p>
