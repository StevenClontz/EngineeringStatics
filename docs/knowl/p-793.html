<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">As the approach and equations vary between systems, it is important to first determine the type of equilibrium problem to be solved. While the details related to the equilibrium of a particle or single rigid body should be reviewed; do not worry if the techniques and equations for trusses, frames, and machines are not clear at this point. We will frequently reference table 6-1 throughout this chapter and will share it again at the end of the chapter. A key skill you will learn in this chapter is to properly classifying a structure as a truss, which are made of all two-force members, versus a frame or machine, which each have at least one multi-force body. In trusses, frames and machines, properly identifying and analyzing two-force members is also very important.</p>
