<li>Solve for reactions (if needed). If your section free-body diagram will include reaction forces, go back to your full section free-body diagram and solve for the reactions you will need on your section free-body diagram.</li>
<li>Draw your section free-body diagram:</li>
<li>Always draw known forces in their known direction and value (whether external, reaction, or interaction) and make sure to include any applied and reaction force which are also applied to the portion of your truss remaining.</li>
<li>Draw unknown forces in assumed directions and uniquely label them. A common practice for trusses is to assume that all unknown forces are in tension (or pulling away from the free-body diagram of the pin) and label them based on the member they represent (like \(F_{AB}\)).</li>
<li>Write out and solve the force equilibrium equations for your section free-body diagram.  If you assumed that all forces were tensile earlier, remember that negative answers indicate compressive forces in the members.</li>
<li>If you have not solved for the required members with one section cut, then add a Method of Joints step or another Method of Sections step. Recall that is is possible to mix and match methods when necessary.</li>
