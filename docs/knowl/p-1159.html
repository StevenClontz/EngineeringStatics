<p>We consciously and subconsciously use centroids for many things in life and engineering, including:</p>
<ul class="no-marker">
<li><p><em class="emphasis">Keeping your body’s balance:</em> Try standing up with your feet together and leaning your head and hips in front of your feet. You have just moved your body’s center of gravity out of line with the support of your feet.</p></li>
<li><p><em class="emphasis">Computing the stability of objects in motion like cars, airplanes, and boats:</em> By understanding how the center of gravity interacts with the accelerations caused by motion, we can compute safe speeds for sharp curves on a highway.</p></li>
<li><p><em class="emphasis">Designing the structural support to balance the structure’s own weight and applied loadings on buildings, bridges, and dams:</em> We design most large infrastructure not to move. To keep it from moving, we must understand how the structure’s weight, people, vehicles, wind, earth pressure, and water pressure balance with the structural supports.</p></li>
