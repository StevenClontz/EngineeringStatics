<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Let us examine how we can put this knowledge to use in a two-dimensional problem. For the \(\Sigma\vec{F}=0\) equation, there are infinite directions in the \(xy\) plane of a two-dimensional problem, so it is best to be strategic on which directions you select. You should recall from Chapter 2 the reason we use the \(xy\) orthogonal coordinate system is that the \(x\) and \(y\) axes are independent of each other because they are perpendicular. Thus, picking any two orthogonal directions to solve the equation \(\Sigma\vec{F}=0\) gives us independent equations to solve for two of the unknowns, which also takes care of two of the degrees of freedom. We are then left with the final rotation degree of freedom. Setting the sum of moments about any of the infinite points in the \(xy\) plane equal to zero ensures no rotational motion is allowed. Often we sum moments around a point on the body, but the equation \(\Sigma\vec{M}_o=0\) works equally as well for points off the body.</p>
