<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">You will notice that the force and the acceleration are in bold face. This means that they are vector quantities, having both a magnitude and a direction. Mass on the other hand is a scalar quantity, which has only a magnitude. Both the definition and equation reflect that the magnitude of the net force is proportional to the acceleration of an object and the direction of the net force also dictates the acceleration direction of the object. As all the bodies in statics are subject to a balance of forces \(\Sigma \vec{F}=0\) it turns out that the linear acceleration \(\vec{a}\) will be equal to zero. Therefore, all bodies having no acceleration will either be at rest or remain at a constant velocity.</p>
