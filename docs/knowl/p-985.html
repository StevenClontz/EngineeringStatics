<p>These trusses are sometimes called  <em class="emphasis">fracture critical trusses</em> because the failure of a single component can lead to catastrophic failure of the entire structure.  With no redundancy, there is no alternative load path for the forces that normally would be supported by that member. You can visualize the fracture critical nature of simple trusses by thinking about a triangle with pinned corners. If one side of a triangle fails, the other two sides lose their support and will collapse. In a full truss made of only triangles, the collapse of one triangle starts a chain reaction which causes others to collapse as well.</p>
