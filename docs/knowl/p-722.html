<p>You may be wondering a couple things:</p>
<ul class="square">
<li>Why are we using the unit vector of DE instead of the full vector DE when taking the dot product? Recall that when taking the dot product that you end up with the projection of the first vector onto a second vector times the magnitude of the second vector. If you only want the projection of the first onto the second vector then set the second vector as a unit vector which has a length of one.</li>
<li>Why do we get a magnitude out of an equation which contains a cross product? You are correct that the cross product will produce a vector.  But, recall that all dot products produce a scalar, hence the result of the two-step cross and dot product is a scalar.</li>
<li>What does it mean if my scalar value is negative? Recall this dot product with a unit vector tell you how much of the moment vector is in the direction of the dot product and negative scalar values tell you that the direction of the moment right-hand rotational axis (analogous to your right-hand thumb) is opposite the unit vectorâ€™s direction.</li>
</ul>
