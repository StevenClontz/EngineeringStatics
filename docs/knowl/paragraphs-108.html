<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">This statement “If two members meet at an unloaded joint, then both members are zero-force members.” is not always true.  If the forces are collinear they are not necessarily zero forces.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">This statement “Simple trusses, by definition, are statically determinate, having an equal number of equations and unknowns.”  is not true.  There are more equations than unknowns.  That's why the last joint can be used to verify the the work.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Too many unordered list.  Need to be fleshed out as paragraphs.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">I have a different way of discussing zero force members.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Simple trusses section- needs reorganization. Combine last three subsections into a section called 'solving a truss' which should discuss what it means to solve a truss, foreshadow the two methods, talk about commonalities and general approach, then include material from labeling, reactions and zero force members.</p>
<p>Summary tables <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/equilibrium-summary.html" title="Table 5.15: Equilibrium Methods">Table 5.15</a>:</p>
<ul class="square">
<li>This table is repeated from the beginning of the chapter</li>
<li>Your definitions need to be more concise.</li>
<li>Tables should not be used for instructio only be a reminder of important conclusions.</li>
<li>Too much text doesn't fit will in narrow columns.</li>
<li>Particle definition: you mean "coincident" not "collinear"</li>
<li>Rigid body definition is confusing</li>
