<article class="paragraphs"><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Statics is a course about forces and we will have a lot to say about them.  At its simplest, a force is a 'push or pull', but forces come from a variety of sources and occur in many different situations.  As such we need a specialized vocabulary to talk about them. One example of defining forces can be found below in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/block_forces.html" title="Figure 1.4.1">Figure 1.4.1</a>. We are also interested in forces that cause rotation, and we have special terms to describe these too.</p>

The loading on the box can be represented by four different forces. The cable causes a point force, the normal and friction forces are reaction forces with the rough surface, and the weight is a body force.</figcaption></figure><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The definitions below describe a few of the force types shown in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/block_forces.html" title="Figure 1.4.1">Figure 1.4.1</a>. Other types of forces will be defined as they are used later in the book.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="Chapter_01-forces.html#paragraphs-2">in-context</a></span>
