<body><article class="insight remark-like"><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">We made a point of saying that equivalent systems of force have the same \(external\) effect on the body.  This implies that there may be some other effects which are not the same.  As you will see in <a href="Chapter_08.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 8: Internal Loadings">Chapter 8</a>, we sometimes need to consider  internal forces and moments.  These are the forces inside a body which hold all the parts of the object to each other, otherwise it would break apart and fail.  Although the external effects are the same for all equivalent systems, the internal forces depend on the specifics of how the loads are applied.</p>

<div class="sbspanel top" style="width:50%;"><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Let’s imagine that you have gone off-roading and have managed to get your Jeep stuck in the mud.  You have two basic options to get it out: you can \(pull\) it out using the winch on the front bumper, or you can ask your friend to \(push\) you out with his truck.  Both methods (assuming that they apply forces with the same magnitude, direction and line of action) are statically equivalent, and both will equally move your vehicle forward.</p></div>

<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The difference is what might happen to your vehicle.  With one method there’s a danger that you will rip your front bumper off, with the other you might damage your rear bumper.  These are the internal effects and they depend on <em class="emphasis">where</em> the equivalent force is applied.  These forces are are necessary to maintain rigidity and hold the parts of the body together.</p></article></body>
