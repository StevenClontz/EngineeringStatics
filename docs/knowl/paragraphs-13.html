<p>A <em class="emphasis">couple</em>, defined as “two equal and opposite forces with different lines of action,” produces a pure turning action that is equivalent to a concentrated moment, called the <em class="emphasis">couple-moment</em>.  Couples and couple-moments have no translational effect. Couple-moments are free vectors, which means that they are not bound to any point.  Their external effect is on the entire body and is the same regardless of where it is applied.</p>
<p>This means that you are free to swap out a couple for its couple-moment, or swap a couple-moment for a couple which has the same moment, and you may put the replacement anywhere on you please and it will still be equivalent.</p>
<p>The diagram shows a series of equivalent transformation of a couple.</p>

In other words moving a concentrated moment from one point to another is an equivalent transformation.  Remember though, this equivalence only applies to the external effects.  What happens inside the body definitely does depend on the specific point where the moment is applied.</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="equivalent-tranformations.html#paragraphs-13" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
