<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">A static system is <em class="emphasis">determinate</em> if the reactions can be found by the methods of statics, that is, by using equilibrium equations.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">In order for a system to be determinate, the number of reaction components must equal the degrees of freedom of the body. In terms of forces and moment equations, the number of unknowns (often reaction forces and moments) equals the number of independent equations of equilibrium. For two-dimensional systems, there are three degrees of freedom . Therefore we can determine no more than three unknown reaction components.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">An indeterminate system with fewer reaction components than degrees of freedom is <em class="emphasis">under-constrained</em> and therefore unstable. On the other hand, if there are more reaction components than degrees of freedom, the system is both <em class="emphasis">over-constrained</em> and <em class="emphasis">indeterminate</em>.<em class="emphasis"></em>In terms of force and moment equations, the there are more unknowns than  than equilibrium equations and so they can't be determined.  This is not to say that it is impossible to find the reaction force on an over-constrained system, just that you will not be learning how to find them in this course.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="Chapter_05-stability-and-determinacy.html#paragraphs-68">in-context</a></span>
