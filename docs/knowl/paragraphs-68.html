<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Frames and machines are structures which contain multiple rigid body systems.  Frames don't move and are designed to support loads.   Machines are generally designed to multiply forces, and usually have moving parts.  Both frames and machines can be solved using the same methods.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">All interactions between bodies are equal and opposite action-reaction pairs.</p>
<p>When solving frames and machines</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Two-force members provide one useful equilibrium equation, and can determine one unknown.</li>
<li>In two dimensions, rigid bodies result in two two scalar force equations and one scalar moment equation. Up to three unknowns can be determined.</li>
<li>In three dimensions, rigid bodies produce three scalar force equations and scalar three moment equations. Up to six unknowns can be determined.</li>
