<div class="para">The three-finger right-hand rule technique relies on the basic body geometry that your extended index finger, middle finger, and thumb are all perpendicular to each other. If you can align your index finger with the first vector you are crossing and your middle finger with the second vector you are crossing, then your thumb will point in the direction of the cross-product vector. Alternately, if you align your thumb with the first vector you are crossing and your index finger with the second vector you are crossing, then your middle finger points in the direction of the cross-product vector. We prefer to use the index-crossed-into-middle version as it results in a thumb-direction cross product in the same way the point-and-curl method does below.</div>
