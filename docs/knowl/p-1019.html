<p>The procedure to solve for unknown forces using the method of sections is</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Determine if a truss can be modeled as a <a href="Chapter_06-trusses.html#simple-trusses" class="internal" title="Subsection 6.3.2: Simple Trusses">simple truss</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Identify and eliminate all <a href="Chapter_06-trusses.html#zero-force-members" class="internal" title="Subsection 6.3.4: Zero-Force Members">zero-force members</a>. Removing zero-force members is not required but may eliminate unnecessary computations.</p></li>
<li><p>Solve for the external reactions, if necessary. Reactions will be necessary if the reaction forces act on the section of the truss you choose to solve below.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Use your imaginary chain saw to cut the truss into two pieces by cutting through some or all of the members you are interested in.  The cut does not need to be a straight line.</p>
<p>Every cut member exposes an unknown internal force, so if you cut three members youâ€™ll expose three unknowns.  Exposing more than three members is not advised because you create more unknowns than available equilibrium equations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the easier of the two halves of the truss and draw its free-body diagram.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Include all applied and reaction forces acting on the section, and show known forces acting in their known directions.</p></li>
<li><p>Draw unknown forces in assumed directions and label them. A common practice is to assume that all unknown forces are in tension and label them based on the endpoints of the member they represent.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Write out and solve the equilibrium equations for your chosen section.  If you assumed that unknown forces were tensile, negative answers indicate compression.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have not found all the required forces with one section cut, repeat the process using another imaginary cut or proceed with the method of joints if it is more convenient.</p></li>
