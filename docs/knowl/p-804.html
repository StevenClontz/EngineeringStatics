<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">A basic concept that can help you think about structural systems is load paths. Load paths are conceptually how an applied load (like the gravity load in the image below) is passed through the interconnected members of a structural system and end up being supported by the reactions (which in the image below are the earth beneath the footings). All structural systems, whether non-moving frames or moving machines have some sort of load path. This is also a good concept to think about for your problem solving, where we need to computationally move from our known values (often applied loads) down through the interconnected bodies of the system, solving for unknowns as you go.</p>
