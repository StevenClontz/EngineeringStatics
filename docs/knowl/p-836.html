<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Finally, finding a zero-force member in a determinate truss does not mean you can discard the member. Stability is always a loading-independent issue. Zero-force members can be thought of as removed from the analysis but this is only true for the exact loading you are currently analyzing. After removing zero-force members, you are left with the simplest truss which will still connect the reaction and applied forces with triangles. If you misinterpret the rules you may over-eliminate members and be left with missing legs of triangles or ‘floating’ forces that have no load path from the remaining members.</p>
