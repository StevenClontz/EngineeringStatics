<p>This step is pure mathematics.</p>
<p>Here are some tips if you are doing integration “by hand”. Be neat,  work carefully, and check your work as you go along. Use proper mathematics notation: don't lose the differential <span class="process-math">\(dx\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(dy\)</span> before the integration step, and don't include it afterwords.  Don't forget to use equals signs between steps.  Simplify as you go and don't substitute numbers or other constants too soon.  Pay attention to units: Area <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> should have units of <span class="process-math">\([\text{length}]^3\)</span> and the first moments of area <span class="process-math">\(Q_x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q_y\)</span> should have units of <span class="process-math">\([\text{length}]^3\text{.}\)</span> If your units aren't consistent, then you have made a mistake.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="centroids-by-integration.html#li-385" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
