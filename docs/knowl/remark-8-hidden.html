<body><article class="remark remark-like"><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\(dA\) is just an area, but an extremely tiny one.  It's an example of an <dfn class="terminology">differential quantity</dfn>—<dfn class="terminology"></dfn>also called an <dfn class="terminology">infinitesimal</dfn>.  A differential quantity is value which is as close to zero as it can possibly be without actually being zero.  You can think of its value as \(\frac{1}{\infty}\text{.}\) Integration is the process of adding up an infinite number of infinitesimal quantities.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Some other differential quantities we will see in statics are \(dx\text{,}\) \(dy\) and \(dz\text{,}\) which are infinitesimal increments of distance; \(dV\text{,}\) which is a differential volume; \(dW\text{,}\) a differential weight; \(dm\text{,}\) a differential mass, and so on.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Any product involving a differential quantity is itself a differential quantity, so if the area of a vertical strip is given by \(dA =y\ dx\) then, even though height \(y\) is a real number, the area is a differential because \(dx\) is differential.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">If you like, you can pronounce the \(d\) as “the little bit of” so \(dA = y\ dx\) reads “The little bit of area is the height \(y\) times a little bit x.” and \(A = \int dA\) reads “The total area is the sum of the little bits of area.”</p></article></body>
