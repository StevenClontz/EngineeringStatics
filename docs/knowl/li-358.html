<p>This step is pure mathematics.</p>
<p>Here are some tips if you are doing integration “by hand”. Be neat,  work carefully, and check your work as you go along. Use proper mathematics notation: don't lose the differential \(dx\) or \(dy\) before the integration step, and don't include it afterwords.  Don't forget to use equals signs between steps.  Simplify as you go and don't substitute numbers or other constants too soon.  Pay attention to units: Area \(A\) should have units of \([\text{length}]^3\) and the first moments of area \(Q_x\) and \(Q_y\) should have units of \([\text{length}]^3\text{.}\) If your units aren't consistent, then you have made a mistake.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="centroids-by-integration.html#li-358">in-context</a></span>
