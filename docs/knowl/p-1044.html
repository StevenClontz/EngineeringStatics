<p>Remember from Chapter 5 Rigid Body Equilibrium how you were limited to three linearly independent equations per rigid body free-body diagram? It turns out that the relationship still holds here, but now we have more free-body diagrams to use. Hereâ€™s a few more details on the number of equations that come from each type of two-dimensional free-body diagram:</p>
<ul class="square">
<li>
<em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">Two-force members. One equation:</em> Recall that two-force members can be recognized as either a cable or a weightless link with all forces coming from two frictionless pins. The available equation simply tells you that the force at one pin is equal and opposite to the force on the other placing the body in tension or compression.</li>
<li>
<em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">Multi-force rigid body with concurrent forces. Two equations:</em> These are the same type of problems you solved in Ch. 3: Equilibrium of Particles with only two equations available \(\Sigma F_x = 0\)  and  \(\Sigma F_y = 0\text{.}\)</li>
<li>
<em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">Multi-force rigid body with offset forces and/or couples. Three equations:</em> These are the most general body types where you can use  \(\Sigma F_x = 0\text{,}\)  \(\Sigma F_y = 0\text{,}\)  and\(\Sigma M = 0\) to solve for three unknowns.</li>
