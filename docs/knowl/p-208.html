<p>There are two ways to graphically add vectors: the Triangle Rule and Parallelogram Rule. Note that in this section we focus on problems where just two vectors are summed to find their resultant. When you need to find the resultant of more than two vectors, it is typically best to use the Algebraic Addition of Components below.</p>
<ul class="square">
<li>For the Triangle Rule, place the tail of one vector at the tip of the other vector, then draw the resultant from the first vector's tail to the final vector's tip.</li>
<li>Next for the Parallelogram Rule, you line up the tails of both vectors, then complete a parallelogram with extension lines parallel to each vector. The resultant is equal to the diagonal from the tails to the opposite corner.</li>
</ul>
