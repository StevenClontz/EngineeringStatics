<article class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Unit Vectors Using Sine and Cosine.</span></h5>
<p>While unit vectors may seem to be a new concept to you, we will demonstrate in this section how you likely have been using unit vector components since you learned your trigonometric identities of sine and cosine.  Let us use the final equivalent equation from <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/notations.html" title="Table 3.3: Various notation used to describe a force \(\vec{F}\)">Table 3.3</a> above:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\vec{F}=F \left &lt; \cos \theta, \sin \theta \right &gt;\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Now focus on the vector components inside the angled brackets in the equation above. Draw a right triangle with the perpendicular sides horizontal and vertical and a hypotenuse of 1. Insert the angle \(\theta\) between the horizontal side and the hypotenuse. What equations do you find for the horizontal and vertical sides? You should discover that \(cos\ \theta\) and \(sin\ \theta\) are the horizontal and vertical components of the unit vector along \(\vec{F}\text{.}\)</p>
<p>To further prove this fact, let us look at unit vectors in the context of the Pythagorean Theorem. The Pythagorean Theorem tells us that the sum of the squares of the length of both orthogonal legs of a right triangle must equal the square of the length of the hypotenuse. So, if \(\cos\ \theta\) and \(\sin\ \theta\) are the orthogonal components of the unit vector \(\hat{F}\) and the length of the unit vector is 1, then putting these values into the Pythagorean Theorem gives us:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\left ( \cos \theta \right )^2 + \left (\sin \theta \right) ^2 = 1^2
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p></p>
<p>which can be further simplified to</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Reflect for a few seconds if the equation above looks familiar. It should ring a bell from your earlier learning in geometry as the equation for a circle with a radius of 1 unit. Hence, no matter what the angle \(\theta\) from a horizontal axis to a line, the terms \(\cos\ \theta\) and \(\sin\ \theta\) make up the components of the unit vector along the line. Note that if the angle \(\theta\) is measured from a vertical axis, then the sine and cosine flip, with \(\sin\ \theta\) defining the horizontal component and the \(\cos\ \theta\) defining the vertical component of the unit vector.</p>
<p>Use <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/unit_vector_ggb.html" title="Figure 3.18">Figure 3.18</a> below to investigate further the components of both a force and its unit vector.</p>
<figure class="figure figure-like"><div style="width:600px;"><p id="p-149">This interactive shows the graphical expression and component values a force vector \(\vec{F}\) and its unit vector \(\hat{F}\text{.}\)</p></div>
