<p>Draw a free-body diagram for each of the members in the structure. You must represent all forces acting on each member, including:</p>
<ul class="square">
<li>Applied forces and couples and the weights of the components if non-negligible.</li>
<li>Interaction forces due to two-force members.  There will be force of unknown magnitude but the known direction at  points connected to two-force members.  The forces will act along the line between the two connection points.</li>
<li>All reaction forces and couples at the connection points between members. Forces with an unknown magnitude and direction are usually represented by  unknown \(x\) and \(y\) components, but can also be represented as a force with unknown magnitude acting in an unknown direction.</li>
</ul>
