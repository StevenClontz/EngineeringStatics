<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Analysis of structures involves applying the techniques you have learned in the previous chapters to solve for the forces acting on and between individual members of the structure.  Fundamentally there is nothing new here, however the problems tend to have more unknown forces, and so are more involved and provide more opportunities for error than the problems you have previously encountered.  Clear diagrams and careful work are required, as always.</p>
