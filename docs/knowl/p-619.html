<p>For the remainder of this chapter, we will limit our analysis to beams, which are structural elements primarily designed to support vertical loads. When designing a beam it is important to locate the points of maximum shear and maximum moment and their magnitudes because that's where it is most likely to fail. To find these weak points, we need to check the internal loading at every point along the beam's full length. We use shear and bending moment diagrams to do this.</p>
