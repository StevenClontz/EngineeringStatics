<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Another simplification we will be making is to treat all forces as <dfn class="terminology">concentrated forces</dfn>. Concentrated forces act at a single point, have a well defined line of action, and can be represented with an arrow â€” in other words, they are vectors.
