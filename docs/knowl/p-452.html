<p>Once the location of the cut has been decided, we separate the free body diagram of the member into two independent free body diagrams, one above the cut and one below. This is analogous to the Method of Sections technique of <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">[provisional cross-reference: Chapter_06]</code>. The free body diagrams for the two sections of the member are shown in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/frame_2.html" title="Figure 4.9">FigureÂ 4.9</a>.  The three internal forces are are exposed and labeled \(\vec{A}\text{,}\) \(\vec{V}\text{,}\) and \(\vec{M}\text{.}\) Either free body diagram can be used to solve for the internal forces, so it is wise to choose the easier one.   Recognizing which one is easier takes practice, but look for the piece with more knowns and fewer unknown values.</p>
