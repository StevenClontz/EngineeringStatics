<p>The top and bottom pieces of an I-beam are called flanges. The middle portion is referred to as the web. The flanges take most of the internal compression and tension forces as they are located the furthest from the neutral axis, and the web mainly acts to support any shear forces and hold the two flanges apart.  The transverse axis through the centroid of the cross section is called the neutral axis, and cutting plane through the beam at the neutral axis is called the neutral plane, or neutral surface.  This surface does not lengthen or shorten during bending.</p>
