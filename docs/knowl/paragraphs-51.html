<p>What's our point of view.</p>
<p>Are we directing the students?  You start by ...</p>
<p>Are we collaborating with the students?  We can see that...</p>
<p>Should we avoid ‘you’ and ‘we’ and make statements.  The result is...</p>
<p>It is all over the place in the text.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Redundancy.  I'm seeing a lot of it.  We will need to clean this up later.</p>
<p>The text has a lot of procedures versus explanations.  Need to think about if that's what we want.</p>
<p>Tables for layout and explanations.  That's bad.  Need to consider all these tables, and use them for summaries only</p>
<p>The term 'Axial' force should only be used for two-force members with an obvious axis, in other cases call it the normal force.</p>
<p>Typography in diagrams and interactive should follow math typesetting rules used in the text, so italics for variables, upright for units, et.</p>
<p>Don't use the same variable name to mean two different things.  You are using A for the reaction at A as well as the axial force, which I would call the normal force.  Especially confusing in the frame example where Ax and Ay are not the components of A??</p>
<p>Another reason I want more than red for forces is that it is very helpful on <abbr class="acronym">FBDs</abbr> to use one color for knowns, and another for unknowns.  Also color is helpful to differentiate different forces and identify which geogebra label belongs to which.</p>
<p>This is tough to accomplish, but in a series of related diagrams, the digrams should all be rendered at the same scale.</p>
<p>SVG images should have transparent backgrounds, so not to clash with the blue background in examples.</p>
<p>Arbitrary cut method second example is not finished.  Needs to do the other two segments and produce the equations and plot them.</p>
<p>The local-global equation interactive needs some context</p>
<p>When deriving dm/dx you use dx/2 as distance to centroid of loading.  This is sloppy and needs explanation.</p>
<p>Need at some examples which conclude with a complete VM diagram.</p>
<p>Need to work on geogebra applets for fit and consistency.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="backmatter-chapter-notes.html#paragraphs-51">in-context</a></span>
