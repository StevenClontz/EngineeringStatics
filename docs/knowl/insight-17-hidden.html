<body class="ignore-math"><article class="insight remark-like"><p>To provide some context for area moments of inertia, let’s examine the internal forces in a elastic beam. Assume that some external load is causing an external bending moment which is opposed by the internal forces exposed at a cut.</p>
<p>When an elastic beam is loaded from above, it will sag.  Fibers on the top surface will compress and fibers on the bottom surface will stretch, while somewhere in between the fibers will neither stretch or compress.  The points where the fibers are not deformed defines a transverse axis, called the <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">neutral axis</dfn>.  The neutral axis passes through the centroid of the beam’s cross section.</p>
<p>The change in length of the fibers are caused by internal compression and tension forces which increase linearly with distance from the neutral axis. The internal forces sum to zero in the horizontal direction, but they produce a net couple-moment which resists the external bending moment.</p>

This moment at a point on the face increases with with the square of the distance <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(y\)</span> of the point from the neutral axis because both the internal force and the moment arm are proportional to this distance.  The appearance of <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(y^2\)</span> in this relationship is what connects a bending beam to the area moment of inertia.</p>
<p>The shape of the beam’s cross-section determines how easily the beam bends. A beam with more material farther from the neutral axis will have a larger moment of inertia and be stiffer. Of course, the material of which the beam is made is also a factor, but it is independent of this geometrical factor.</p></article></body>
