<p>In this problem, the knowns are the magnitude and direction of force <span class="process-math">\(\vec{B}\)</span> and moment <span class="process-math">\(\vec{C}\)</span> and the dimensions of the beam.</p>
<p>The constraints are the frictionless pin at <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and the rocker at <span class="process-math">\(D\text{.}\)</span>  The pin prevents translation but not rotation, which means two it has two unknowns, represented by either magnitude and direction, or by two orthogonal components.  The rocker provides a force perpendicular to the surface it rests on, which is <span class="process-math">\(\ang{30}\)</span> from the horizontal.  This means that the line of action of force  <span class="process-math">\(\vec{D}\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(\ang{30}\)</span> from the vertical, giving us its direction but not its sense or magnitude</p>

<div class="sbspanel top" style="width:48%;"><p>To draw the free body diagram, start with a neat rectangle to representing the beam disconnected from its supports, then draw and label known force <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> and moment <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> and the dimensions.</p></div>

<p>Add forces <span class="process-math">\(A_x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(A_y\)</span> representing vector <span class="process-math">\(\vec{A}\)</span> and force <span class="process-math">\(\vec{D}\)</span> at <span class="process-math">\(D\text{,}\)</span> acting <span class="process-math">\(\ang{30}\)</span> from the vertical.</p>
<p>When a force has a known line of action as with force <span class="process-math">\(\vec{D}\text{,}\)</span> draw it acting along that line; donâ€™t break it into components.  When it is not obvious which way a reaction force actually points along its lines of action, just make your best guess and place an arrowhead accordingly.  Your calculations will confirm or refute your guess later.</p>
<div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:0%;margin-right:0%;">
<div class="sbspanel top" style="width:48%;"><p>As in the previous example, you could alternately represent force <span class="process-math">\(\vec{A}\)</span> as an unknown magnitude acting in an unknown direction, though there is no particular advantage to doing so in this case.</p></div>
