<p>Choose the standard <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span> coordinate system, since it aligns well with the forces.</p>
<p>The wall at <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is a fixed support which prevents the beam from translating up, down, left or right, or rotating in the plane of the page. These constraints are represented by two perpendicular forces and a concentrated moment, as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/reactions-from-supports-2d.html" title="Figure 5.2.1">FigureÂ 5.2.1</a>.  Label these unknowns as well.</p>
<p>The knowns in this problem are the magnitudes and directions of moment <span class="process-math">\(\vec{C}\text{,}\)</span> forces <span class="process-math">\(\vec{B}\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vec{D} \)</span> and the dimensions of the beam.  The unknowns are the two force components <span class="process-math">\(A_x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(A_y\)</span> and the scalar moment <span class="process-math">\(M_A\)</span> caused by the fixed connection.  If you prefer, you may represent force <span class="process-math">\(\vec{A}\)</span> as a force of unknown magnitude acting at an unknown direction.  Whether you represent it as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> components or as a magnitude and direction, there are two unknowns associated with force <span class="process-math">\(\vec{A}\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>The three unknown reactions can be found using the three independent equations of equilibrium we will discuss later in this chapter.</p>
