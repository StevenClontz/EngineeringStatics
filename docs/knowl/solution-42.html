<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Siri says that “The average distance from the earth to the sun is 92,958,412 miles.”</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">That's a pretty exact answer.  What does it mean, exactly?  From what point on the earth to what point on the sun?  We could assume that the earth and sun are perfect spheres, and measure the distance between their centroids.  With more information we could find their centers of mass and measure between those points.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The bigger problem is that the distance to the sun changes continuously as the earth revolves around the sun.  How can we find an average value for something which is continuously changing? We will need to use integration to average the distance as a function of time, over the course of a year using the methods described here..</p>
