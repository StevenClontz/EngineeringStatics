<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The magnitude of a force is measured in units of mass [m] times length [L] divided by time [t] squared [\(F=\text{m L}/\text{t}^2\)]. In metric units, the most common force unit is the newton [N] where one newton is a kilogram multiplied by a meter per second squared. This means that a one-newton force would cause a one-kilogram object to accelerate at a rate of one-meter-per-second-squared. In English units, the most common unit is the pound-force [\(\lbf{}\)], or pound [lb] for short, where one pound is the force which can accelerate a mass of one slug at one foot per second squared.  It is worth noting that many physics texts use pounds mass [\(\lbm{}\)] exclusively instead of slugs, where  \(\slug{1} = \lbm{32.174}\text{.}\) This text will use slugs as they are the standard mass unit in US customary system and so are analogous to kilograms in the SI system.</p>
