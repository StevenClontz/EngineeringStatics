<p>Newton’s first law also applies to angular velocities, however instead of force, the relevant quantity which causes an object to rotate is called a <dfn class="terminology">torque</dfn> by physicists, but usually called a <dfn class="terminology">moment</dfn> by engineers.  A moment, as you will learn in <a href="Chapter_04.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 4: Moments and Static Equivalence">Chapter 4</a>, is the rotational tendency of a force. Just as a force will cause a change in linear velocity, a moment will cause a change in angular velocity.  This can be seen in things like tops, flywheels, stationary bikes, and other objects that spin on an axis when a moment is applied, but eventually stop because of the opposite moment produced by friction.</p>
