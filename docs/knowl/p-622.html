<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Drawing a <abbr class="acronym">FBD</abbr> in three-dimensions can be difficult.  It is sometimes hard to see things in three-dimensions when they are drawn on a two-dimensional sheet.  Consequently, it is important to carefully label vectors and angles, but not to clutter up the diagram with too much and/or unnecessary information.  When working in two-dimensions, you only need one angle to determine the direction of the vector, but when working in three-dimensions you actually need three angles.  When drawing the free-body diagram, you usually only label one of these, many times you donâ€™t label any angles, but instead use geometry to show the direction that the vector points.</p>
