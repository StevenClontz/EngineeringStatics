The components are usually orthogonal and in the coordinate directions, or in a given plane and perpendicular to it, but any combination of components forces that adds to the original force is equivalent.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><img src="external/images/equiv_forces.svg" role="img" class="contained" alt="A fixed ring is shown with two forces F1 and F2. This is equal to a fixed ring with the resultant force shown acting at an angle of theta from the horizontal, which would be pointing towards the coordinates (F1x+F2x, F1y+F2y). This is equal to a fixed ring with a horizontal force of F*cos(theta) and vertical force of F*sin(theta)."></div>

</div> <div class="para">An interesting special case occurs when two forces are equal and opposite and have the same line of action.  When these are added together, they cancel out, so replacing these two forces with nothing is an equivalent transformation.  The opposite is true as well, so you can make two equal and opposite forces spontaneously appear a point if you wish.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="equivalent-tranformations.html#paragraphs-11" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
