<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">One new issue we have to face in three-dimensional problems is that some reaction couples are available but not engaged. Before we get into the details for reaction couples, let us discuss what we mean by the word <em class="emphasis">engaged</em>. Picture a crate sitting at rest on a horizontal surface. If you were to attach a cable to the top of the crate, but not pull on the cable, the tension in the cable would be available but not <em class="emphasis">engaged</em> in this condition. Instead, the floor’s normal force would be supporting the full weight of the crate without need of the tension force in the cable. If we were to remove the floor under the crate, then the cable’s tension force would be engaged to support the weight of the crate.</p>
