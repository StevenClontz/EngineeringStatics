<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Every member of a truss is a two-force member. Recall from [xref 4.2.4 Two-force bodies] that a two-force member is a body which is subjected only to a pair of compression or tension forces with and no couples exerted anywhere on the body.</p>

<figcaption xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">5.3<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>The two possible types of two-force members, tension and compression.</figcaption></figure><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">For a two-force member to be in equilibrium, the force vectors need to be 1) equal in magnitude, 2) opposite in direction, and 3) collinear or sharing the same line of action. By this definition, two-force members are not required to be slender, straight members, but can always be recognized by having only two pins connected to other bodies/supports and having no other loading beyond external forces applied at the pins.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The common way to express the unknown axial force in each two-force member is with a magnitude and a sense, where the sense is expressed as either tension (T) or compression (C). To further investigate the nature of the pure axial forces of tension (T) and compression (C) let us look at the effect of tension pulling and compression pushing on each joint and member in the figure below.</p>

<figcaption xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">5.4<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>In the figure above, notice how the tension, in member AB, <em class="emphasis">pulls</em> on every member and joint, while the compression, in AD and BD, <em class="emphasis">pushes</em> on each member and joint. This diagram also helps us see that using the free-body diagrams of two-force members we can only verify that the forces are equal and opposite, but by using the free-body diagrams of the joints (which is detailed further in the Method of Joints below) we are able to include all reaction and applied forces as well.</figcaption></figure><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"></p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">When analyzing trusses, we are looking to identify the axial forces acting within each member for a given loading. In mechanics classes taken after Statics, you will be able to use these axial forces to select a material and design the cross sectional properties of each member. Later in Ch 8: Internal Loading within Rigid Bodies chapter of this book, you will analyze additional internal loadings in members, including shear force and bending moment.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="Chapter_06-introduction.html#paragraphs-61">in-context</a></span>
