<p>The other unit system in use is the United States customary system.  This system was developed from the measurement system in use in the British Empire before the US became an independent country. However, the United Kingdomâ€™s system of measures was overhauled in 1824 to create the Imperial system, changing the definitions of some units. Therefore, while many US units are similar to their Imperial counterparts, there are significant differences between the systems. The base units in the customary system for time, distance, and mass are the second, foot, and slug.</p>
