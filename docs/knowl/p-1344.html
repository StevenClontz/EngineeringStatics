<p>Here are some tips if you are doing integration “by hand”. Be neat,  work carefully, and check your work as you go along. Use proper mathematics notation: don't lose the differential <span xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="process-math">\(dx\)</span> or <span xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="process-math">\(dy\)</span> before the integration step, and don't include it afterwords.  Don't forget to use equals signs between steps.  Simplify as you go and don't substitute numbers or other constants too soon.  Pay attention to units: Area <span xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="process-math">\(A\)</span> should have units of <span xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="process-math">\([\text{length}]^3\)</span> and the first moments of area <span xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="process-math">\(Q_x\)</span> and <span xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="process-math">\(Q_y\)</span> should have units of <span xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="process-math">\([\text{length}]^3\text{.}\)</span> If your units aren't consistent, then you have made a mistake.</p>
