<p>Most screws are right-hand threaded, which means that when you are looking at the head of a screw and rotate the top of the screw to the right, it tightens (commonly taught as “righty-tighty”). Another way to think about the relationship between screw rotation and motion uses the right-hand rule. When you make a thumbs up with your right hand, if you rotate a screw towards your fingertips (clockwise = CW), then the screw will move in the direction of your thumb (as shown in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/screw_rhr.html" title="Figure 5.16">Figure 5.16</a>). Of course, the reverse is true as well if you want to loosen the screw from its nut.</p>
