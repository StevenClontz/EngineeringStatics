<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Notice that to solve for the three unknowns that we summed moments about \(A\text{,}\) \(B\text{,}\) and \(C\text{.}\) Each equation was efficient â€” yielding a single unknown. The same solutions could have been found with any other set of equations following the three rules shared previously. If you choose another equation that has not already been used, you will end up checking our solutions. In the case of \(\Sigma \vec{F}_x=0\) we would find that \(\lb{100}-\lb{50}-\lb{50}=0\) which confirms that our solutions are accurate.</p>
