<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Next, determine if you need to solve for the reactions first using the full section free-body diagram, or if you can solve for them as part of the Method of Joints. Joints are treated as a series of particles. As all forces on joints are concurrent, these forces can be solved with equilibrium force equations, but moment equations do not add any information. Thus each 2D joint yields two equations (\(\Sigma F_x=0\) and \(\Sigma F_y=0\)). To be able to solve for the unknowns at a joint in a step-by-step fashion, you’ll need ≤ 2 unknowns at each joint and ≥ 1 known force at each joint. If there are no joints that satisfy this condition and you would like to solve for the unknown forces in a step-by-step manner, then you will need to solve for the truss reactions first before starting the Method of Joints.</p>
