<p>The procedure is straightforward application of rigid body and particle equilibrium</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Determine if the structure is a truss and if it is determinate. See <a href="Chapter_06-trusses.html#simple-trusses" class="internal" title="Subsection 6.3.2: Simple Trusses">Subsection 6.3.2</a></p></li>
<li><p>Identify and remove all zero-force members. This is not required, but will eliminate unnecessary computations. See <a href="Chapter_06-trusses.html#zero-force-members" class="internal" title="Subsection 6.3.4: Zero-Force Members">Subsection 6.3.4</a>.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Determine if you need to find the external reactions.  If you can identify a solvable joint immediately, then you do not need to find the external reactions.</p>
<p>A solvable joint includes one or more known forces and no more than two unknown forces.  If there are no joints that satisfy this condition then you will need to find the external reactions before proceeding, using a free-body diagram of the entire truss.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify a solvable joint and solve it using the methods of <a href="Chapter_03.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 3: Equilibrium of Particles">Chapter 3</a>. When drawing free-body diagrams of joints you should</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Represent the joint as a dot.</p></li>
<li><p>Draw all known forces in their known directions with arrowheads indicating their sense.  Known forces are the given loads, and forces determined from previously solved joints.</p></li>
<li><p>Assume the sense of unknown forces. A common practice is to assume that all unknown forces are in tension, i.e. pulling away from the free-body diagram of the pin,  and label them based on the member they represent .</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, write out and solve the force equilibrium equations for  the joint. If you assumed that all forces were tensile earlier, negative answers indicate compression.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Once the unknown forces acting on a joint are determined, carry these values to the adjacent joints and repeat step four until all the joints have been solved.  Take care when transferring forces to adjoining joints to maintain their sense — either tension or compression.</p></li>
<li><p>If you solved for the reactions in step two, you will have more equations available than unknown forces when you reach the last joint.  The extra equations can be used to check your work.</p></li>
