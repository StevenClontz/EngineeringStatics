<p>This image was composed of three parts,</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>The x-z plane and the three ropes were drawn in Geogebra, and a screenshot was used to capture the image as a png.  For 2D drawings Geogebra can export svg or png directly.</li>
<li>The balloon was a png image.</li>
<li>Both were imported into a svg image in Inkscape, where the axis labels, point labels, and the height were added with the text tool. The dotted line, and the dimension arrows were drawn in using Inkscape's tools.</li>
</ol>
