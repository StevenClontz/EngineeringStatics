<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">This rotational tendency is known as the moment of the force, or more simply the <dfn class="terminology">moment</dfn>. You may be familiar with the term <em class="alert">torque</em> from physics. Engineers use “torque” where physicists use “moment” to describe the same concept.   Moments are vectors, so they have magnitude and direction and obey all rules of vector addition and subtraction described in <a href="Chapter_02.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 2: Forces and Other Vectors">Chapter 2</a>.  Additionally, moments have a <em class="emphasis">center of rotation</em>, although it is more accurate to say that they have an axis of rotation. In two dimensions, the axis of rotation is perpendicular to the plane of the page and so will appear as a <dfn class="terminology">point of rotation</dfn>, also called the <dfn class="terminology">moment center</dfn>. In three dimensions, the axis of rotation can be any direction in 3D space.</p>
