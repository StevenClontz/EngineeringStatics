<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">All structures fall into one of three broad categories: trusses, frames, and machines.  A key skill you will learn in this chapter is to properly classify structures.</p>

The scissors consist of three interconnected bodies.  The bridge is a truss.</figcaption></figure><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">A <em class="emphasis">truss</em> is a multi-body structure made up of long slender members connected at their ends in triangular subunits.  Truss members carry axial forces only,  Trusses are commonly used for spanning large distances without interruption: bridges, roof systems, stadiums, aircraft hangers, auditoriums for example.  Trusses are also used for crane booms, radio towers and the like. They are lightweight and relatively strong.  Over the years many unique truss designs have been developed and are often named after the original designer.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">A <em class="emphasis">frame</em> is a multi-part, rigid, stationary structure primarily designed to support some type of load.  A frame contains at least one multi-force member, which a truss never has. This means that, unlike trusses, frame members must support bending moments as well shear and normal forces.  Many common items can be considered frames.  Some examples: building structure, furniture, ladders, scaffolding, and more.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">A <em class="emphasis">machine</em> is very similar to a frame, except that it includes some moving parts.  The purpose of a machine is usually to provide a mechanical advantage and multiply forces.  Pliers, scissors jacks, automobile suspensions, construction equipment are all examples of machines.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><em class="emphasis">Solving</em> a structure means determining all forces acting on all the parts of the structure.  The solution typically begins by determining the global equilibrium of the entire structure, then breaking it into parts and analyzing each separate part.  The specific process will depend on the type of structure, but will always follow the principles covered in the previous chapters.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="Chapter_06-introduction.html#paragraphs-75">in-context</a></span>
