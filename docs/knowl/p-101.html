<p>The vector’s <dfn class="terminology">magnitude</dfn> is a <em class="emphasis">positive real number</em> including units which describes the ‘strength’ or ‘intensity’ of the vector. Graphically a vector’s magnitude is represented by the length of its vector arrow, and symbolically by enclosing the vector’s symbol with vertical bars.  This is the same notation as for the absolute value of a number.  The absolute value of a number and the magnitude of a vector can both be thought of as a distance from the origin, so the notation is appropriate. By convention the magnitude of a vector is also indicated, by the same letter as the vector, but in an non-bold font.</p>
