<p>Let’s suppose that the line of action goes through two points \(A\) and \(B\text{,}\) and the direction of the force is from \(A\) towards \(B\text{.}\)  The first step in determining the three angles is to write the distance vector from point \(A\) towards point \(B\text{.}\)  Let’s call this vector \(r_{AB}\text{.}\)  Starting at point \(A\text{,}\) you need to determine how to get to point \(B\) by moving in each of the three directions.  Ask yourself: to get from point \(A\) to point \(B\) do I have to move in the \(x\) direction? If so, how far do I have to travel?  This becomes the \(x\) component of the vector \(r_{AB}\) namely \(r_{AB_x}\text{.}\)  Next, to get from point \(A\) to point \(B\) how far do I move in \(y\) direction? This distance is \(r_{AB_y}\text{.}\)  Finally, to get from point A to point B how far do I move in the z-direction?  This distance is \(r_{AB_z}\text{.}\)</p>
