<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Frame and machines are engineering structures that contain at least one multi-force member. As their name implies, multi-force members have more than two points of application of point loads, distributed loads present and/or couples applied to them and therefore are not two-force members. Note that all bodies we investigated in Ch 5 Equilibrium of Rigid Bodies were all multi-force bodies. Refer to Table 6-1 for the details of how frames and machines compare to other equilibrium systems.</p>
