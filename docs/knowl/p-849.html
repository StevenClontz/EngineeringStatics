<p>The basic process for drawing a free body diagrams is</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Select and isolate an object.</span></span><p>The “free-body” in free-body diagram means that the body to be analyzed must be free from the supports that are physically holding it in place</p>
<p>Simply sketch a quick outline of the object as if it is floating in space disconnected from everything. Do <em xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis">not</em> draw free-body diagram forces on top of your problem drawing — the body needs to be drawn free of its supports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Select a reference frame.</span></span><p>Select a right-handed coordinate system to use as a reference for your equilibrium equations. If you are using something other than a horizontal <span xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="process-math">\(x\)</span> axis and vertical <span xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="process-math">\(y\)</span> axis, indicate it on your diagram.</p>
<p>Look ahead and select a coordinate system which minimizes the number of unknown force components in your equations. The choice is technically arbitrary, but a good choice will simplify your calculations and reduce your effort. If you and another student pick different reference systems, you should both get the same answer, while expressing your work with different components.</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Identify all loads.</span></span><p>Add vectors arrows representing the applied forces and couple-moments acting on the body. These are often obvious. Include the body’s weight if it is non-negligible. If a vector has a known line of action, draw the arrow in that direction; if its sense is unknown, assume one. Every vector should have a descriptive variable name and a clear arrowhead indicating its direction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Identify all reactions.</span></span><p>Traverse the perimeter of the object and wherever a support was removed when isolating the body, replace it with the forces and/or couple-moments which it provides. Label each reaction with a descriptive variable name and a clear arrowhead.   Again, if a vector’s direction is unknown just assume one.</p>
<p>The reaction forces and moments provided by common two-dimensional supports are shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/reactions-from-supports-2d.html" title="Figure 5.2.1">Figure 5.2.1</a> and three dimensional support in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/reactions_table_3D.html" title="Figure 5.2.2">Figure 5.2.2</a>.  Identifying the correct reaction forces and couple-moments coming from supports is perhaps the most challenging step in the entire equilibrium process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Label the diagram.</span></span><p>Verify that every dimension, angle, force, and moment is labeled with either a value or a symbolic name if the value is unknown.  Supply the information needed for your calculations, but don't clutter the diagram up with unneeded information;  This diagram should be a “stand-alone” presentation.</p>
