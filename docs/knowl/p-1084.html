<p>Draw a free-body diagram for each of the members in the structure. You must represent all forces acting on each member, including:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Applied forces and couples and the weights of the components if non-negligible.</p></li>
<li><p>Interaction forces due to two-force members.  There will be force of unknown magnitude but the known direction at  points connected to two-force members.  The forces will act along the line between the two connection points.</p></li>
<li><p>All reaction forces and couples at the connection points between members. Forces with an unknown magnitude and direction are usually represented by  unknown <span xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="process-math">\(y\)</span> components, but can also be represented as a force with unknown magnitude acting in an unknown direction.</p></li>
