<p>For equilibrium of a particle, usually the origin of the coordinate frame is at the particle, the \(x\) axis is horizontal, and the \(y\) axis is vertical just as in a two-dimensional situation.  The \(z\) axis is determined by the <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/rhr2.html" title="Figure 2.6">right hand rule</a>.  Using your <em class="emphasis">right hand</em>, put your palm at the origin and point your fingers along the positive \(x\) axis.  Then curl your fingers towards the positive \(y\) axis.  Your thumb will point in the direction of the positive \(z\) axis.  In this case, if the positive \(x\) axis is horizontal and to the right, and the positive y-axis is vertical and upwards, then the positive \(z\) axis will be coming <em class="emphasis">towards</em> you.  Remember that the three axes are mutually perpendicular, i.e. each axis is perpendicular to both of the others.  The right hand rule is important in many aspects of engineering, so make sure that you understand how it works.  Mistakes will lead to sign errors.</p>
