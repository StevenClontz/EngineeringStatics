<p>The United States customary units are a system of measurements commonly used in the United States. The United States customary system developed from English units which were in use in the British Empire before the U.S. became an independent country. However, the United Kingdom's system of measures was overhauled in 1824 to create the imperial system, changing the definitions of some units. Therefore, while many U.S. units are essentially similar to their Imperial counterparts, there are significant differences between the systems. The standard units for time, distance, and mass in Statics are a second, foot, and slug. Note that this text does not use pounds mass, instead opting to use slugs for all US customary units masses and avoiding the pounds mass vs. pounds-force confusion.</p>
