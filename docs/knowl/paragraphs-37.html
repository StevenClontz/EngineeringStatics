<p>A truss is a structure which consists entirely of two-force members and only carries forces at the joints connecting members.  Two-force members and loading at joints allows free-body diagram of the joints to expose the axial loads in members.</p>
<p>In addition to the equations provided by treating the entire truss as a rigid body, each joint provides two additional equations for two-dimensional trusses, and three for non-planar trusses.</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="Chapter_06-summary.html#paragraphs-37">in-context</a></span>
