<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Cutting a straight member in a truss exposes the internal force which must be properly represented on the free-body diagram. Internal forces of a truss are all in equal and opposite pairs, think about the tension forces in a two-force member being equal and opposite pulling on each end. Hence, all interaction and internal forces which are not exposed by cutting or isolating members have an opposing force which effectively cancels them out. Only when we cut through a member or joint in the isolation step of creating a free-body diagram, do we expose all the forces which come from the interaction of the surrounding bodies.</p>
