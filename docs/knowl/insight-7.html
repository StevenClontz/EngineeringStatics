</h5>
<p>We can solve trusses using the methods of joints and method of sections because all members of a simple truss are two-force bodies.  Cutting a truss member exposes an internal force which has an unknown scalar magnitude, but a known line of action.  The force acts along the axis of the member, and causes no bending if the member is straight.  Cutting a truss member exposes <em class="emphasis">one</em> unknown.</p>
<p>Frames and machines are made of multi-force members and cutting these, in general, exposes:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>A force with an unknown magnitude acting in an unknown direction, and</p></li>
<li><p>A bending moment at the plane of the cut.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Cutting a two-dimensional multi-force member exposes <em class="emphasis">three</em> unknowns, and <em class="emphasis">six</em> are exposed for a three-dimensional body. The number of unknowns quickly eclipses the available equations rendering the problem impossible to solve.</p>
<p>Bottom line: use method of sections and joints <em class="emphasis">only</em> for trusses made of two-force straight members; for all other multi-force rigid body systems draw and analyze free-body diagrams of the components.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="frames-and-machines.html#insight-7" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
