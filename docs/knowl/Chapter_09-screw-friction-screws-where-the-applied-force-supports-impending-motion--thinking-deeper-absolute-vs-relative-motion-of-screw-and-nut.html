<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">As we have seen, screws typically rotate but can be designed to for the screw or nut to translate depending on the intended use. To better understand the use of screws and nuts, it is valuable to learn about the differences between absolute and relative motion. Absolute motion is the motion you observe from a stationary reference point. The speed of a car or the velocity of the wind are all typically measured from an absolute (or non-moving) reference frame. When we choose to measure the same terms from a moving reference frame, they are considered relative motion terms. For example, the velocity of a car relative to a moving train is a relative velocity term. We typically label absolute velocity with a single variable subscript, like the velocity of car \(C\) could be written \(\vec{v_C}\text{.}\) Relative velocities we write with a slash between the two moving objects, like a fraction in the subscript. So, the velocity of the car \(C\) relative to the moving train \(T\) is written \(\vec{v_{C/T}}\text{.}\) The relationship between the absolute and relative velocities of two particles can be written as:</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
\vec{v}_C=\amp \vec{v}_T-\vec{v}_{C/T} \text{ or } \\
\vec{v}_{C/T}\amp =\vec{v}_C - \vec{v}_T
\end{align*}
</div>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"></p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The relative motion of a fixed object can also be measured from the reference frame of a moving object. Thus, we find that the stop sign’s relative velocity with respect to a moving car is equal and opposite to the car’s absolute velocity.</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\vec{v}_{S/C} =\vec{v}_S-\vec{v}_C 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">but since the velocity of the stop sign is zero,</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\vec{v}_{S/C} =-\vec{v}_C\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"></p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The same concept can be applied to screws and nuts. In a system where a screw both translates and rotates, but the nut is stationary, you would find that the relative translation direction of the nut is equal and opposite to the absolute translation of the screw. We will use relative motion for this and other friction topics in Statics also heavily in Dynamics.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="Chapter_09-screw-friction.html#Chapter_09-screw-friction-screws-where-the-applied-force-supports-impending-motion--thinking-deeper-absolute-vs-relative-motion-of-screw-and-nut">in-context</a></span>
