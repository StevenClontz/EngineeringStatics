<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Now let's examine the two-force member shown in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/dogleg_cut.html" title="Figure 8.1.2">FigureÂ 8.1.2</a>. This time, the member is <em class="emphasis">L</em> shaped, not straight, but the external forces must still share the same line of action to maintain equilibrium. If you cut across the object, you will obtain two rigid bodies which must also be in equilibrium. However, adding forces perpendicular to the cuts won't produce static equilibrium since the forces aren't in opposing directions.  If you cut vertically and apply horizontal forces, that won't produce equilibrium either because equal and opposite forces offset like this form a couple and the pieces will rotate. This means that something is missing!</p>
