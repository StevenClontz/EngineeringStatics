<p>This book began as the vision of a handful of the authors to create a free textbook filled with interactives instead of static figures. Spurred into action by funding opportunities in the Fall of 2018, the team worked on the book through 2019 and launched this working draft version in Fall 2020. Over the two years of creating the book, our team grew to a coast-to-coast representation of large public universities, small private colleges, and community colleges.</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="preface.html#paragraphs-3">in-context</a></span>
