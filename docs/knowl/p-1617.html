<p>One of the fundamental assumptions we make in statics is that bodies are <em class="emphasis">rigid</em>, that is, they do not deform, bend, or change shape when forces and moments are applied. While we know that this assumption is not true for real materials, we are building the analytical tools necessary to analyze deformation. In this chapter you will learn to compute the internal loads, which are the forces and moments within a body which hold it together as it supports its own weight and any applied loads.</p>
