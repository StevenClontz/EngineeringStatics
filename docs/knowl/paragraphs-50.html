<p>Following the logic of Method 1, it turns out that the larger tension <span class="process-math">\(T_L\)</span> is always in the direction of the impending motion of the belt. It does not matter if the belt motion is relative (like in the example for Method 1 above) or absolute, the larger tension is always in the impending motion of the belt. If you are still learning the differences between relative and absolute motion, see the section above.</p>
<p>There are likely other robust ways to determine the smaller and larger sides of tension in a flexible belt system; make sure you learn a method that works for both potentially moving and also fixed-belt systems.</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="Chapter_09-flexible-belt-friction.html#paragraphs-50" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
