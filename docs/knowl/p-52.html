<p>Another way to express the directions of the \(x\text{,}\) \(y\text{,}\) and \(z\) axes are with unit vectors.  A unit vector is a vector with a magnitude of one, and no units.  As such, a unit vector represents a pure direction.  It's a vector that points in a certain direction.  By convention a unit vector is indicated by a 'hat' over a vector symbol.  Because they occur frequently, the unit vectors in each of the three Cartesian coordinate directions are their own symbol, which are:</p>
