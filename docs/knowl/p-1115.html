<p>All of the free-body diagrams we have drawn are correct, though not all are necessary.  Generally we only draw the free-body diagrams needed for the solution.  These diagrams form a chain which connect the known input forces to the desired output forces.  When solving frames and machines, think carefully about what you know and what you need to solve for: that determines which free-body diagrams you will need.  Taking a few moments to consider what unknowns youâ€™d have at each step can help you optimize your problem-solving effort.</p>
