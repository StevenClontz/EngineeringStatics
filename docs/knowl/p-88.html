<p>Choosing a strategy gets easier with experience. Unfortunately, the way you get that experience is to solve problems.  It seems like a chicken and egg problem and it is, but there are ways around it. Here are some suggestions which will help you become a better problem-solver.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Get fluent with the math skills from algebra and trigonometry.</p></li>
<li><p>Do lots of problems, starting with simple ones to build your skills.</p></li>
<li><p>Study worked out solutions, however don't assume that just because you understand how someone else solved a problem that you can do it yourself without help.</p></li>
<li><p>Solve problems using multiple approaches. Confirm that alternate approaches produce the same results, and try to understand why one method was easier than the other.</p></li>
<li><p>Draw neat, clear, labeled diagrams.</p></li>
<li><p>Familiarize yourself with the application, assumptions, and terminology of the methods covered in class and the textbook.</p></li>
<li><p>When confused, identify what is confusing you and ask questions.</p></li>
</ul>
