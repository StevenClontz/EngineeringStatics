<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">It also isn't a concurrent force problem because the lines of action of the forces don't all intersect at a single point.  However,  we can make it into one by replacing the forces of the three cables in each direction with a single force three times larger.  This is an example of an <em class="emphasis">equivalent transformation</em>, a trick engineers use frequently to turn complex situations into  simpler ones.  It works here because all the tensions are equal, and the outside wires are equidistant from the center wire.  You must be careful to to justify all equivalent transformations, because they will lead to errors if they are not applied correctly.  Equivalent transformations will be discussed in greater detail in  <a href="equivalent-tranformations.html" class="internal" title="Section 4.5: Equivalent Transformations">SectionÂ 4.5</a> later.</p>
