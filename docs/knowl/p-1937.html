<p>As we have seen, screws typically rotate but can be designed to for the screw or nut to translate depending on the intended use. To better understand the use of screws and nuts, it is valuable to learn about the differences between absolute and relative motion. Absolute motion is the motion you observe from a stationary reference point. The speed of a car or the velocity of the wind are all typically measured from an absolute (or non-moving) reference frame. When we choose to measure the same terms from a moving reference frame, they are considered relative motion terms. For example, the velocity of a car relative to a moving train is a relative velocity term. We typically label absolute velocity with a single variable subscript, like the velocity of car <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> could be written <span class="process-math">\(\vec{v_C}\text{.}\)</span> Relative velocities we write with a slash between the two moving objects, like a fraction in the subscript. So, the velocity of the car <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> relative to the moving train <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> is written <span class="process-math">\(\vec{v_{C/T}}\text{.}\)</span> The relationship between the absolute and relative velocities of two particles can be written as:</p>
