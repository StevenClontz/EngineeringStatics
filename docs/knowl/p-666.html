<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Moments can exist in three-dimensional systems as well as two-dimensional systems. The main challenge when getting these is that moments now can exist in all three component directions, as opposed to only around the  \(z\) axis. two-dimensional moments we expressed with rotational arrows as we were looking straight at the \(\pm z\) axis of rotation. Three-dimensional moments are shown in this book as a red double-headed arrow and can be drawn in vector space just like a force or position vector.</p>
