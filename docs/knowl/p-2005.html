<div class="para">As we can see from the equation above, steeper sides to the groove (corresponding to a smaller groove angle <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span>) result in an increased potential difference in the tension forces. The trade-off with steeper sides, however, is that the belt becomes wedged more firmly in the groove and requires a higher force to unwedge itself as it leaves the pulley. This unwedging force decreases the efficiency of the belt-driven system. An alternate design choice would be a chain-driven system which carries very high-tension differences more efficiently.</div>
