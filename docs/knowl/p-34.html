<p>This law, also sometimes called the “law of inertia,” means that bodies maintain their current velocity unless a force is applied to change that velocity. In other words, if an object is at rest it will remain at rest until the resultant force (or net sum of forces) is out of equilibrium and changes the velocity, and if an object is moving at a constant velocity (which includes both speed and direction), it will remain at that same velocity until a force begins to change the velocity.</p>
