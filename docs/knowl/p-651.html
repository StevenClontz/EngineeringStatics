<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Like forces, moments have a positive and negative direction. Since moments are rotational, they may also be referred to by their direction of rotation: clockwise or counterclockwise. Using the right-hand rule convention, counter-clockwise moments are positive and clockwise moments are negative. As shown in figure BB and CC below, there are multiple ways to use your right hand to determine the sign of a moment. They all produce the same answer, so you donâ€™t need to learn all techniques, but make sure you find one of them which you can use accurately and consistently.</p>
