<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">While the moments discussed up to this point of the chapter have all been due to a single force, there is a special type of moment called a couple which is caused by a pair forces which must be 1) equal in magnitude, 2) opposite in direction, and 3) non-collinear (not sharing the same line of action). This moment is called a couple. Couples are common in mechanics and have a unique effect that the force resultant is zero, due to the equal and opposite forces. However, the sum of the moments produced by these forces is not zero. Couples, therefore, have a tendency to produce rotational motion but no translational motion.  For this reason, couples are sometimes referred to as “pure moments.”</p>
