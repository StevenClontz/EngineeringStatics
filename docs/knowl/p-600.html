<p>For equilibrium of a particle, usually the origin of the coordinate frame is at the particle, the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> axis is horizontal, and the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> axis is vertical just as in a two-dimensional situation.  The orientation of the <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> axis is determined by the <dfn class="terminology">right hand rule</dfn>.  Using your <em class="emphasis">right hand</em>, put your palm at the origin and point your fingers along the positive <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> axis.  Then curl your fingers towards the positive <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> axis.  Your thumb will point in the direction of the positive <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> axis.  In this case, if the positive <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> axis is horizontal and to the right and the positive <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> axis is vertical and upwards, the positive <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> axis will be coming <em class="emphasis">towards</em> you.  Remember that the three axes are mutually perpendicular, i.e. each axis is perpendicular to both of the others.  The right hand rule is important in many aspects of engineering, so make sure that you understand how it works.  Mistakes will lead to sign errors.</p>
