<p>A few additional notes include:</p>
<ul class="square">
<li>Commonly, rigid trusses have only three reaction forces, resulting in the equation:<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
2\times (\text{number of joints})=3 + (\text{number of members})
\end{equation*}
</div>
</li>
<li>Unstable trusses lack the structural members to maintain their rigidity when removed from their supports. They can also be recognized using the equation above having more system equations on the left side of the equation above then system unknowns on the right.</li>
<li>Truss systems with redundant members have fewer system equations on the left side of the equation above than the system unknowns on the right. While they are indeterminate in Statics, in later courses you will learn equations to solve for member stretching and compression you will gain more equations for these trusses can be solved</li>
