<p>Statics is a course about forces and we will have a lot to say about them.  At its simplest, a force is a “push or pull,” but forces come from a variety of sources and occur in many different situations.  As such we need a specialized vocabulary to talk about them. We are also interested in forces that cause rotation, and we have special terms to describe these too.</p>
