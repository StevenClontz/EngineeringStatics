<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">As we are now dealing with multi-body systems, we need to revisit Newton's 3rd Law (from Chapter 1), “For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.” We apply this law to multi-body systems as the reactions applied to one body will be transferred equal and opposite to the interacting bodies. So practically we could restate Newton's 3rd law for interaction forces, “For every force on a body, there is an equal, opposite, and collinear force acting on the connecting body.”</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="Chapter_06-introduction.html#paragraphs-62">in-context</a></span>
