<p>Let’s suppose that the line of action goes through two points <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> and the direction of the force is from <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> towards <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span>  The first step in determining the three angles is to write the distance vector from point <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> towards point <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span>  Let’s call this vector <span class="process-math">\(\vec{r}_{AB}\text{.}\)</span>  Starting at point <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> you need to determine how to get to point <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> by moving in each of the three directions.  Ask yourself: to get from point <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to point <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> do I have to move in the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> direction? If so, how far do I have to travel?  This becomes the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> component of the vector <span class="process-math">\(\vec{r}_{AB}\)</span> namely <span class="process-math">\(r_{AB_x}\text{.}\)</span>  Next, to get from point <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to point <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> how far do I move in <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> direction? This distance is <span class="process-math">\(r_{AB_y}\text{.}\)</span>  Finally, to get from point A to point B how far do I move in the z-direction?  This distance is <span class="process-math">\(r_{AB_z}\text{.}\)</span></p>
