<p>The process used to analyze frames and machines is outlined below:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">First, determine if we can model the entire structure as a rigid body.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">To do this, the structure needs to be independently rigid. This means that it would be rigid even if we separated it from its supports. Look for triangles formed among the members, as triangles are inherently rigid.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">If the structure is independently rigid, you will be able to model the structure as a single rigid body to determine the reaction forces acting on the structure. If the structure is not independently rigid then skip this step.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"></p>
<figure class="figure figure-like"><div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="image-box" style="width: 70%; margin-left: 15%; margin-right: 15%;"><img src="images/frame-ex-1.png" class="contained" alt=""></div>
<figcaption xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">6.5.3<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>If, and only if, the structure is independently rigid, you should analyze the whole structure as a single rigid body to solve for the reaction forces. Note the triangle formed between pins \(B\text{,}\) \(C\text{,}\) and \(D\text{.}\)</figcaption></figure>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next draw a free-body diagram for each of the members in the structure. You will need to include all forces acting on each member, including:</p>
<ul class="square">
<li>All applied forces/couples that may be acting at the members.</li>
<li>Interaction forces from two-force members. Recall, at connection points with two-force members there will be single force of unknown magnitude but the known direction (the forces will act along the line between the two connection points on the member).</li>
<li>Next, add in the remaining reaction forces/couples at the connection points between members. For forces with an unknown magnitude and direction (such as in pin joints) the forces are often drawn in as having unknown x and y components.</li>
</ul>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Remember that the interaction forces/couples between connected bodies will be equal and opposite.</p>
<figure class="figure figure-like"><div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="image-box" style="width: 70%; margin-left: 15%; margin-right: 15%;"><img src="images/frame-ex-2.png" class="contained" alt=""></div>
<figcaption xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">6.5.4<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>Separate the structure into individual components and draw a free-body diagram of each component. It is important to remember that the forces at each connection point are equal and opposite.</figcaption></figure>
</li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Write out the equilibrium equations for each free-body diagram.</p></li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Finally, solve the equilibrium equations for the unknowns. You can do this algebraically, solving for one variable at a time, or you can use matrix equations to solve for everything at once. If your algebra tells you that any force/couple is negative, that indicates that the assumed direction of that term should be flipped in direction.</p></li>
