<p>All of the free-body diagrams we have drawn are correct, though not all are necessary and some are more useful than others.  We do not generally draw any but the free-body diagrams needed for the solution.  These diagrams form a chain of objects which connect the known input forces to the desired output forces.  When solving frames and machines, think carefully about what you know and what you need to solve for: that determines which of your FBD choices you will need.  Taking a few moments to consider what unknowns youâ€™d have at each step can help you optimize your problem-solving effort.</p>
