<dt>Applied Forces</dt>
<dd><p>Applied forces are the external forces which a rigid body or system of rigid bodies is being designed to support. They are often given in a problem and you will be asked to find the reaction and interaction forces developed by them.</p></dd>
<dt>Body Forces</dt>
<dd><p>Body forces are gravitational weight forces of rigid bodies within a system. To maintain the assumption that trusses are formed of two-force members, all included weight forces must be split in two and distributed to the pins on either end of a truss member.</p></dd>
<dt>Reaction Forces</dt>
<dd><p>Reaction forces come from support pins, support rollers, or support two-force members interacting with the outside world.</p></dd>
<dt>Interaction Forces</dt>
<dd><p>Interaction forces are caused by the connection of one body with all the others it touches. Hence, when looking at the force on a pin joint, we would include all the forces coming from all members and reactions connected to that pin joint.</p></dd>
<dt>Internal Forces</dt>
<dd><p>Internal forces are the forces developed within the members of a truss. For trusses with straight members, the internal forces are compression and tension.</p></dd>
