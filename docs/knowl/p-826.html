<p>Drawing correct free body diagrams is the single most important step for solving equilibrium problems. You are encouraged to find a repeatable process for creating them.  We suggest following these five steps.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>
<h6 class="heading"><span class="title">Isolate.</span></h6>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The “free body” in free body diagram means that the body to be analyzed must be free from the supports that are physically holding it in place. Sketch an outline of the object as if it is floating in space. To reiterate, do <em class="emphasis">not</em> draw free body diagram forces on top of your problem drawing — the body needs to be drawn free of its support for a free body diagram to be created.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h6 class="heading"><span class="title">Axis.</span></h6>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Establish a right-hand coordinate system to use as a reference for your equilibrium equations. Any right-hand system works, but look ahead and select one which minimizes the number of unknown force components in your equations. The choice is technically arbitrary, but a good reference system should help you solve the problem. If you and another student pick different reference systems, you should both get the same answer, while expressing your work with different components.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h6 class="heading"><span class="title">Loasd.</span></h6>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Add vectors representing the applied forces and couple moments acting on the body.  Include the body's weight if it is available. Every vector should have a descriptive variable name and a clear arrowhead indicating its direction.   If a vector’s direction is unknown, you must assume one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h6 class="heading"><span class="title">Reactions.</span></h6>
<p>Traverse the perimeter of the object and replace the supports removed by isolating the body with equivalent forces and couple moments (collectively <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">reactions</em>) provided to the body. There are two ways to find the reactions from supports:</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>Supports provide the type (force or moment) and direction of support a body needs to resist applied loads</li>
<li>Each support type provides a limited set of possible reactions as shown in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/reactions_table.html" title="Figure 5.1.1">Figure 5.1.1</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Interpreting the correct reaction forces and couple moments coming from supports is perhaps the most challenging step in the entire equilibrium process. Label each reaction with a descriptive variable name and a clear arrowhead.   Again, if a vector's direction is unknown just assume one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h6 class="heading"><span class="title">Dimensions.</span></h6>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Give all pertinent dimensions and angles on the free body diagram, but don't clutter it up with unneeded information;  supply only the dimensions and angles you need for your calculations.   This diagram should be a “stand-alone” presentation.</p>
</li>
