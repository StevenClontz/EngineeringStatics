<p>Additional key points to keep in mind regarding zero-force members include:</p>
<ul class="square">
<li>Finding zero-force members is iterative. Once you find some, eliminate them and go look for others.</li>
<li>The zero-force rules above only have to apply to one end of a member (not both) to determine that the whole member is a zero-force member. Keep in mind that all zero-force members started as two-force members which have exactly the same axial load on either end, hence if one end has zero force, the other does as well.</li>
