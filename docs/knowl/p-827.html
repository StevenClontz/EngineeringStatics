<p>While finding zero-force members is a handy tool to minimize computations in Statics. In the real world, zero-force members may have minimal axial forces, but not truly ‘zero force’ for multiple reasons:</p>
<ul class="square">
<li>The weight of members is typically ignored in Statics truss computations. Even if we distributed the member weight to the pins as required to keep the members two-force, these additional pin forces would tend to negate either rule.</li>
<li>Another function of truss members is to support the members they interact with as members deform under load. When we call a member a zero force, we essentially remove it from our analysis. One issue with this is if the member it is attached to begins buckling in compression, the zero-force member will be engaged to prevent this buckling.</li>
<li>Trusses are often used over a wide array of loading conditions - think about how the position of the weight of a truck changes relative to the bridge it is driving over. Thus, while a member may have zero force for one load condition, it will likely be engaged given other loading conditions.</li>
</ul>
